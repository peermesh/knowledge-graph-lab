### Recommended Model Usage

**For optimal AI assistance:**

- **Auto model** - Use for free/infinite usage (best for quick tasks)
- **Sonnet 4.5 (brain reasoning model)** - Use for most work and planning (best for complex reasoning)
- **Composer 1** - Use for speed and decent results in most cases (best for fast iteration)

---

## Phase 3 MVP Readiness

**MVP Success Criteria:**

- ✅ Module runs in Docker successfully
- ✅ All critical functionality implemented
- ✅ Basic API endpoints functional
- ✅ Integration points ready for testing
- ✅ Documentation complete

**Readiness Assessment:**

- What's needed to reach MVP?
- What gaps remain?
- Timeline to completion?
- Blocker identification?

---

## Next Meeting Deliverables

**Required for Next Meeting (November 10, 2025 - In-Person 2-Hour Working Session):**

**🚨 CRITICAL: Everyone Must Show Up Prepared With:**

### **1. Live Docker Demo**
- ✅ **System running in Docker** - Demonstrate what currently works (doesn't need to be perfect)
- ✅ **Show progress** - Demonstrate the functionality that's operational, even if incomplete
- ✅ **Stable enough to demo** - System should run without crashing during demonstration
- 📝 **Note:** This is an **iterative process** - we'll work through multiple iterations to reach the final MVP. Unknowns and incomplete features are expected. The goal is to show progress, not perfection.

### **2. Code Committed to Repository**
- ✅ **All work committed to your branch** - Nothing should be uncommitted
- ✅ **Branch pushed to remote** - Ensure your branch is accessible in the repository
- ✅ **Clean commit history** - Organized, logical commits that tell the story of your work

### **3. Comprehensive Review Document**
Each team member must bring a complete review including:

📋 **Template Available**: 
- [Module Review & Gap Analysis Template](../templates/module-review-template.md) - The template to fill out
- [Detailed Guide](../templates/module-review-template-guide.md) - Complete instructions with examples for each section

**Required Sections:**

**What You've Done:**
- ✅ Summary of completed work
- ✅ Features implemented
- ✅ Components built
- ✅ Integration points completed

**Concerns & Issues:**
- ✅ **Full list of concerns** - Things that look like they weren't done correctly
- ✅ **Known bugs or problems** - Issues you've identified
- ✅ **Unclear requirements** - Areas where specs were ambiguous
- ✅ **Technical debt** - Shortcuts taken that need addressing

**Remaining Work:**
- ✅ **What's left to do** - Specific tasks to complete standalone module
- ✅ **Blockers identified** - What's preventing completion
- ✅ **Timeline estimate** - How long to finish remaining work
- ✅ **Dependencies** - What you need from others or the system

**Standalone Module Assessment:**
- ✅ **Current state** - How close to standalone module status
- ✅ **Gap analysis** - What's missing to be truly standalone
- ✅ **Success criteria** - What "done" means for your module

### **Meeting Format:**
This is a **2-hour in-person working session** where we'll have time to:
- Review each demo in detail
- Discuss concerns and blockers
- Plan remaining work together
- Make progress on integration points

**Important Notes:**
- ⏳ **This is NOT a hard deadline** - We're iterating toward MVP, not expecting perfection on the first try
- 🔄 **Iterative process** - We'll meet multiple times and refine until we reach the final MVP
- ✅ **Show progress** - Each iteration should show meaningful progress from the previous one
- 🎯 **Working demo** - System should be stable enough to demonstrate (not crashing), but doesn't need to be feature-complete
