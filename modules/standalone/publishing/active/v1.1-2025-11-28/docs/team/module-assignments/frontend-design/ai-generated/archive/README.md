# Archived Files - Old Format

**Date archived:** 2025-11-07

**Reason:** Replaced by dual-output format (moved to work-in-progress/ai-generated/)

## What's here

### actionable-task-list.md (987 lines)
**Created:** 2025-09-30

**Format:** Single-document actionable task list

**Problems:**
- Invented content (Node.js v18+, specific tech not in conversation)
- Mixed implementation with requirements
- Not traceable to source conversation

**What worked:**
- Visual structure
- Automation hints
- Dependency tracking

### detailed-requirements-from-vision.md (640 lines)
**Created:** 2025-09-30

**Format:** Detailed requirements document

## Format Evolution

These files represent early attempts before establishing the dual-output methodology.

**Current format:** See `work-in-progress/ai-generated/` directory for:
- `2025-10-09-frontend-decisions-agreements.md` (scannable extraction)
- `2025-10-09-frontend-implementation-guide.md` (actionable tasks with provenance)

## Why Preserved

Historical record of methodology evolution:
- Learning from invention issues → extraction discipline
- Learning from usability issues → dual-output format
- Anti-patterns documented for future reference

**See work-in-progress/ai-generated/ directory for current dual-output methodology.**
