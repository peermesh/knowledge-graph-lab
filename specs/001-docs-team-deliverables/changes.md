From the spec.md, we should change:
User Story 6 - Multi-language Entity Processing (Priority: P3) 
We don't need multi language entity processing.
FR-001 need changes, we don't need to stick to 5 core entity types, try to not restrict it to core entity types.
FR-006 need changes, we should have a dynamic dimensional embedding size rather than fixxing it to 768.
SC-003 need changes, we dont want core entity types.
SC-004 need changes, we dont want core relationship types.
SC-015 need changes, we dont want multi language entity processing
