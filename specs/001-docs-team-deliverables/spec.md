**Feature Branch**: `001-docs-team-deliverables`  
**Created**: 2025-10-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "docs/team/deliverables/requirements-kit-v2/ai-module-spec.md" --format=implementation --output=.dev/ai/speckit-output/ai-module --validate-constitution --enable-tdd --parallel-safe

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Entity Extraction from Documents (Priority: P1)

As a content analyst processing daily news feeds for investment insights, I need to upload documents and receive extracted entities with confidence scores, so that I can quickly identify investment opportunities and competitive landscape changes without manually reading through thousands of documents.

**Why this priority**: This is the core capability that enables all downstream intelligence features. Without accurate entity extraction, the entire AI module cannot deliver value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a sample news article and verifying that organizations, people, funding amounts, dates, and locations are correctly extracted with appropriate confidence scores within 5 minutes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a news article containing mentions of OpenAI, Microsoft, and $10B funding, **When** submitted for entity extraction with normal priority, **Then** system returns OpenAI (95% confidence), Microsoft (92% confidence), and $10B (98% confidence) within 5 minutes
2. **Given** 100 articles queued for processing, **When** extraction pipeline executes, **Then** all articles processed at 100 documents/hour with 90% of key entities correctly identified
3. **Given** a document with mixed content quality, **When** extraction completes, **Then** confidence scores properly reflect extraction certainty with low-confidence entities (<70%) flagged for review

### User Story 2 - Knowledge Graph Relationship Queries (Priority: P1)

As a publishing team member curating personalized content feeds, I need to query the knowledge graph for entity relationships and patterns, so that I can create targeted content recommendations based on current market dynamics and entity connections.

**Why this priority**: This enables intelligent content personalization that distinguishes the platform from basic keyword matching, directly impacting user engagement.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by querying for "OpenAI funding" and verifying that Microsoft appears as a funding source with relationship strength and confidence scores within 2 seconds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** knowledge graph contains 50,000+ entities, **When** user searches for "OpenAI funding", **Then** results returned within 2 seconds showing funding relationships with confidence scores
2. **Given** a relationship query for 3-degree connections, **When** query executes, **Then** system returns complete relationship graph with filtering by relationship types (fund, partner, acquire, compete, collaborate)
3. **Given** 500 concurrent users querying the graph, **When** peak load occurs, **Then** system maintains sub-2-second response time with 99.9% uptime

### User Story 3 - Interactive Knowledge Exploration (Priority: P2)

As a frontend user exploring competitive intelligence, I need to search for specific entities and visualize their relationships interactively, so that I can understand competitive landscapes and market dynamics for strategic decision-making.

**Why this priority**: This provides the user-facing intelligence discovery capability that transforms extracted data into actionable insights.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by searching for a company name and verifying that an interactive graph displays with related connections, filtering options, and exploration of 3+ degrees of relationships.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a search for "OpenAI", **When** results display, **Then** interactive graph shows related entities with visual encoding of confidence scores and relationship strength
2. **Given** exploration of entity relationships, **When** user drills down 3 degrees, **Then** system handles navigation smoothly with sub-second response times
3. **Given** 100-500 concurrent users exploring knowledge graphs, **When** system under load, **Then** maintains performance with export capabilities for relationship data

---

### User Story 4 - Automated Document Processing Pipeline (Priority: P1)

As a backend system processing document ingestion, I need to automatically extract entities and update knowledge graphs from new documents, so that the system maintains current and accurate relationship data for all modules without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: This automation enables the platform to scale beyond manual processing capacity and ensures data freshness.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting 100 documents through the backend integration and verifying that entities are extracted, knowledge graph is updated, and processing status is reported within 1 hour.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** backend submits 500 new documents daily, **When** processing pipeline executes, **Then** all documents processed with 10,000+ entities and relationships added to knowledge graph
2. **Given** documents with varying priority levels (high/normal/low), **When** queued for processing, **Then** high-priority jobs execute first with appropriate resource allocation
3. **Given** processing job failures, **When** errors occur, **Then** retry logic activates with exponential backoff and error notifications sent to monitoring systems

---

### User Story 5 - Quality Monitoring and Review (Priority: P2)

As an AI system administrator monitoring extraction quality, I need to review confidence scores and identify patterns requiring model improvements, so that I can maintain high-quality entity extraction and catch accuracy degradation before it impacts users.

**Why this priority**: Quality monitoring ensures the AI module maintains accuracy over time as data patterns evolve.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by processing 1000 documents and verifying that daily quality reports identify low-confidence extractions and accuracy trends with automated alerts for degradation below 80%.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** daily processing of 1000 documents, **When** quality analysis runs, **Then** report identifies entities with confidence below 70% and triggers alerts if accuracy drops below 80%
2. **Given** quality metrics tracked over time, **When** trends analyzed, **Then** system provides performance metrics by entity type and document source with model retraining recommendations
3. **Given** 10,000+ extractions daily, **When** monitoring executes, **Then** drill-down analysis available by document source and entity type within 1 hour of processing completion

### Edge Cases

- **EC-1**: LLM API rate limit exceeded during processing → Queue job for retry with exponential backoff, switch to fallback model provider if available
- **EC-2**: Entity extraction model returns low confidence (<70%) for critical entities → Flag for manual review, continue processing non-critical entities, log for model retraining
- **EC-3**: Vector database connectivity lost during similarity search → Fall back to PostgreSQL-based search, queue vector operations for retry when connectivity restored
- **EC-4**: Document processing job times out after 5 minutes → Cancel job, log timeout reason, retry once with simplified processing pipeline
- **EC-5**: Multiple similar entities detected (company name variations) → Apply deduplication rules, merge entities with confidence-weighted properties, maintain all name variations
- **EC-6**: Relationship extraction identifies contradictory information → Store all relationship claims with source attribution, flag conflicts for manual resolution
- **EC-7**: Knowledge graph update creates circular reference → Detect cycles during validation, break cycle by removing weakest confidence edge, log for review
- **EC-8**: Memory usage spikes during large document processing → Implement chunked processing with memory limits, spill to disk if needed, monitor and alert on memory patterns
- **EC-9**: Entity extraction API costs exceed daily budget → Switch to lighter/cheaper models for remaining capacity, queue high-cost documents for next day processing
- **EC-10**: Empty document submitted for processing → Return appropriate error response, log empty document event, no entities extracted
- **EC-11**: Concurrent users submit identical entity queries → Cache frequently requested entity lookups, return cached results within 100ms, update cache on entity changes
- **EC-12**: Vector embedding generation fails for specific entity types → Use fallback embedding strategy, flag entity for manual embedding assignment, continue processing
- **EC-13**: Knowledge graph reaches maximum node/edge limits → Implement pagination for large result sets, provide partial results with continuation tokens, alert administrators
- **EC-14**: Scheduled quality monitoring job fails to start → Log critical error, alert ops team, retry on next schedule cycle
