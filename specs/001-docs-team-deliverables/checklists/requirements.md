# Specification Quality Checklist: AI Development Module

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-20  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses on requirements and user value without diving into implementation specifics. Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders while maintaining precision.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All 20 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Success criteria are quantified with specific metrics (e.g., "85% precision", "100 documents/hour", "$0.10 per document"). Edge cases cover 15 realistic scenarios in 2-3 line format as required.

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Six prioritized user stories cover all primary flows from entity extraction (P1) through multi-language processing (P3). Each user story includes independent test descriptions and acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format. All functional requirements map clearly to user scenarios.

## Notes

- Specification is comprehensive and implementation-ready
- All quality criteria met on first validation pass
- User stories are properly prioritized with P1 (critical) through P3 (enhancement)
- Success criteria directly support the 75% time savings goal and accuracy targets
- Ready to proceed to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` phase
