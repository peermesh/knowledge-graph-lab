# Tasks: Publishing Module

**Input**: Multi-channel publishing system for delivering AI-powered research insights with personalization and comprehensive analytics
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (technical architecture), spec.md (5 user stories with P1-P3 priorities), data-model.md (5 core entities), contracts/ (15+ API endpoints), research.md (technical decisions)

**Tests**: MANDATORY - TDD required per Knowledge Graph Lab constitution with ‚â•85% coverage, unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. Each story delivers complete, testable functionality.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Backend API**: `src/publishing/` at repository root (per plan.md)
- **Tests**: `tests/publishing/` with unit/, integration/, performance/ subdirectories
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with `publishing_*` schema naming convention
- **External Services**: AWS SES, Slack API, Discord API integrations

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Integration & Testing (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on integration testing completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May share subscriber models with US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 publication system but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1-US3 for engagement data but independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US2 subscriber system but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (MANDATORY) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services that depend on them
- Services before API endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel (different entities)
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: Multi-Channel Publishing (US1)

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (TDD approach):
pytest tests/publishing/contract/test_publications.py -v
pytest tests/publishing/contract/test_publication_status.py -v
pytest tests/publishing/integration/test_multichannel_publishing.py -v

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create publishing_channels model in src/publishing/models/channel.py"
Task: "Create publishing_publications model in src/publishing/models/publication.py"

# Launch external service integrations in parallel:
Task: "Implement email channel integration with AWS SES in src/publishing/integrations/aws_ses.py"
Task: "Implement Slack channel integration in src/publishing/services/slack_service.py"
```

---

## Parallel Example: Team Development Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (Phases 1-2)
2. **Once Foundational is done:**
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Multi-Channel Publishing) + User Story 3 (Real-Time Alerts)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Personalized Newsletters) + User Story 5 (Subscription Management)
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (Analytics & Optimization) + Integration Testing
3. **Stories complete and integrate independently** through comprehensive testing

7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories ‚úÖ

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (Phases 1-2)
2. **Once Foundational is done:**
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Multi-Channel Publishing)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Personalized Newsletters) + User Story 3 (Real-Time Alerts)
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (Analytics) + User Story 5 (Subscription Management)
3. **Stories complete and integrate independently** through automated testing

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies between them
- [US1], [US2], etc. labels map tasks to specific user stories for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD requirement)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

**Total Tasks**: 117 tasks across 9 phases
**Test Coverage**: 100% of user stories include comprehensive TDD test suites
**MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (Multi-Channel Content Publishing) - fully functional after Phase 3
**Constitution Compliance**: ‚úÖ All tasks align with AI-First, Multi-Channel, TDD, Analytics, and Scalable Architecture principles
