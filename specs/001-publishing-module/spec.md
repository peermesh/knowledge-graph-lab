## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Multi-Channel Content Publishing (Priority: P1)

As a content creator managing research insights for multiple professional networks,
I need to select insights and publish to multiple channels simultaneously with consistent formatting,
So that I can maximize reach and impact without manual reformatting for each platform.

**Why this priority**: Core publishing functionality that enables content distribution across all channels, forming the foundation for user engagement and platform value.

2. **Given** publishing job in progress, **When** external service (email/Slack) experiences temporary outage, **Then** system queues failed deliveries and retries automatically with exponential backoff

### User Story 2 - Personalized Newsletter Distribution (Priority: P1)

As a platform administrator managing daily newsletter distribution for 2,000+ subscribers,
I need to schedule and send personalized newsletters based on user preferences and engagement history,

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by updating subscription preferences and verifying content delivery changes, providing value through user control.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** new user with email "researcher@example.com", **When** they configure preferences for email daily and Slack real-time with topics "AI" and "biotechnology", **Then** preferences are saved and next content delivery uses updated settings
2. **Given** user unsubscribes from newsletter during active send, **When** unsubscribe request is processed, **Then** pending deliveries are cancelled and audit trail maintains unsubscribe timing
