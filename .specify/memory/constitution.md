# Knowledge Graph Lab Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. AI-First Research Platform
All features must enhance research capabilities through AI-powered insights, knowledge graph construction, and intelligent content discovery. Every component must contribute to accelerating research workflows and delivering actionable intelligence to users.

### II. Multi-Channel Publishing Excellence
Every publishing feature must support seamless delivery across email, Slack, Discord, and webhook channels with intelligent personalization. Content must be automatically formatted, scheduled, and optimized for maximum user engagement and relevance.

### III. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → Requirements validated → Tests fail → Then implement. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced across all modules. Minimum 85% test coverage required for all business logic with comprehensive integration tests for publishing workflows.

### IV. Comprehensive Analytics Integration
All features must include engagement tracking, performance metrics, and user behavior analytics. Publishing systems must provide real-time insights into content effectiveness, user preferences, and optimization opportunities across all delivery channels.

### V. Scalable Architecture
Design for horizontal scaling from day one. Support 100,000+ concurrent users, 1,000+ newsletters per minute, and 500+ real-time alerts per second. Maintain stateless design with efficient caching and database optimization for research and publishing workloads.

## Technology Standards

**Required Technologies**:
- Language: Python 3.11+ for backend services and AI integration
- Database: PostgreSQL 15+ with JSON support for complex research data
- Cache: Redis 7.0+ for high-performance caching and pub/sub messaging
- Web Framework: FastAPI for async API endpoints and automatic documentation
- AI Integration: OpenAI-compatible APIs for content analysis and personalization

**External Dependencies**:
- Email Service: AWS SES for reliable delivery and comprehensive analytics
- Message Queue: RabbitMQ for async processing and reliable message delivery
- Authentication: JWT tokens for stateless authentication across modules

## Development Workflow

**Quality Gates**:
- All PRs must include comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Performance benchmarks must meet Section 5 targets before merge
- Security review required for any external service integrations
- Code coverage reports must show >85% coverage for new features

**Review Process**:
- Multi-channel publishing features require stakeholder approval
- AI personalization changes need data science team review
- Breaking changes require migration plan and compatibility testing
- All analytics implementations need product team validation

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, team approval, and migration plan. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with core principles. Complexity must be justified with clear business value. Use project documentation for runtime development guidance.
