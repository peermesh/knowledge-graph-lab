# Knowledge Graph Lab

An AI-powered research platform that transforms information chaos into actionable intelligence.

## What We're Building

A system that discovers opportunities, understands relationships, and delivers personalized insights.

### Core Capabilities
- **Discovers** - Continuously monitors hundreds of sources
- **Understands** - Builds knowledge graphs of relationships  
- **Reasons** - Identifies patterns and opportunities
- **Delivers** - Distributes insights through multiple channels

## Architecture Overview

The platform consists of four integrated modules:
- **Backend Infrastructure** - Docker, databases, APIs, authentication
- **Frontend Interface** - React UI, visualizations, user experience
- **AI Intelligence** - LLMs, knowledge graphs, RAG, entity extraction
- **Publishing System** - Multi-channel distribution, personalization
