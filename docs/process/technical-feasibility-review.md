# Technical Feasibility Review Checklist

- **Reviewer Role**: Senior Developer or Technical Architect
- **Purpose**: Ensure all requirements are technically achievable with available technology and resources.
- **Review Duration**: 1-2 hours per specification

---

## Pre-Review Preparation

- [ ] Read complete requirements specification
- [ ] Review Discovery Kit outputs for technology decisions and constraints
- [ ] Understand target deployment environment and infrastructure
- [ ] Identify any external dependencies or integrations

## Constraint Compatibility Review

- [ ] All constraints mutually compatible (no contradictions)
- [ ] Docker constraints feasible given deployment requirements
- [ ] Performance targets achievable with specified technology stack
- [ ] Security requirements implementable without excessive complexity

## Technical Requirements Validation

- [ ] API specifications complete and implementable
- [ ] Database schema requirements realistic for data volumes
- [ ] Integration requirements compatible with existing systems
- [ ] Third-party service requirements available and cost-effective

## Architecture Feasibility

- [ ] Proposed architecture supports scalability requirements
- [ ] Technology stack decisions align with team expertise
- [ ] Development timeline realistic for complexity level
- [ ] Testing strategy adequate for requirements

## Risk Assessment

- [ ] Identify high-risk requirements with mitigation strategies
- [ ] Flag requirements that may require additional research
- [ ] Assess impact of requirement changes on project timeline
- [ ] Document technical debt introduced by requirements

## Review Outcome

Select one outcome and document your rationale:

- [ ] **Approved**: All requirements technically feasible
- [ ] **Needs Revision**: Specific issues identified with suggested fixes
- [ ] **Blocked**: Fundamental technical issues requiring architectural changes

## Common Issues to Watch For

- Template contamination (generic examples copied as requirements)
- Overly restrictive constraints that conflict with each other
- Performance targets that exceed technology capabilities
- Integration requirements for unavailable services
- Security requirements that complicate development excessively

## Documentation Requirements

When completing this review, document:

1. **Review Date**: [Date completed]
2. **Reviewer Name**: [Your name]
3. **Specification Version**: [Version reviewed]
4. **Outcome**: [Approved/Needs Revision/Blocked]
5. **Issues Found**: [List each issue with severity]
6. **Required Changes**: [Specific changes needed for approval]
7. **Estimated Impact**: [Time impact of required changes]

## Escalation Criteria

Escalate to Senior Architect if:

- Fundamental architectural changes required
- Technology stack decisions need reconsideration
- Cross-module conflicts identified
- Timeline impact exceeds acceptable threshold
