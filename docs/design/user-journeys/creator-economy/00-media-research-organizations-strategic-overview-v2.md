# Creator Economy User Journey: Media & Research Organizations Strategic Overview

## What This Person Gets

Instead of spending weeks pulling together creator economy data from different sources and still missing the big picture, these research teams get a complete intelligence platform that does the heavy lifting for them. They can finally focus on analysis and insights instead of data collection, and their reports become the ones everyone else references.

## Quick Reference

- **Persona**: Research Teams - Analysts, Journalists & Academics at Industry Firms, Media Orgs & Universities
- **Core Problem**: Creator economy intelligence is scattered across platforms with no systematic way to collect, verify, and analyze it
- **Key Value**: Complete intelligence automation that turns research teams into market leaders
- **Success Metric**: 65-80% faster research cycles with premium pricing opportunities
- **Priority Level**: High for PRD development

## Persona Profile

### Who They Are

**Job**: These are the people who need to understand what's happening in the creator economy - industry analysts writing reports that companies pay big money for, journalists covering the latest creator trends, and academic researchers studying how platform work is changing labor markets.

**Company**: They work at places like research firms (think smaller versions of McKinsey), business publications (TechCrunch-style), and universities. Some are at big organizations with resources, others are smaller teams trying to compete with limited budgets.

**Background**: Most started in traditional research or journalism before the creator economy became huge. They're smart people who know how to analyze information, but they're drowning in the amount of data they need to track now.

**Tools They Use**: Right now they're stuck with whatever they can cobble together - news alerts, social media monitoring tools, survey platforms, and lots of manual spreadsheet work. Nothing actually connects or gives them the full picture.

### What's Frustrating Them

- **Data Everywhere**: Creator economy information is scattered across platforms, news sites, financial reports, and academic papers with no way to see it all together
- **Always Behind**: By the time they collect enough data to write something meaningful, the story has moved on and competitors have already covered it
- **Can't Verify Fast Enough**: Spending too much time fact-checking and source validation instead of actual analysis and insight development
- **Shallow Analysis**: Resource constraints force them to stay surface-level when they know there are deeper insights that would differentiate their work

## Discovery & Evaluation

### Trigger Event

A major creator economy development breaks (like YouTube's new monetization policy or a huge creator acquisition) and they realize they're completely unprepared. Their current process takes too long, misses key connections, and produces analysis that feels incomplete compared to what they know is possible.

### Evaluation Process

1. **Research Phase**: They discover Knowledge Graph Lab through industry connections or see superior analysis from early adopters
2. **Technical Assessment**: IT teams evaluate data security, API integration capabilities, and compliance with organizational standards
3. **Business Case**: Leadership calculates ROI based on faster research cycles, premium pricing opportunities, and competitive advantage

## Implementation Journey
