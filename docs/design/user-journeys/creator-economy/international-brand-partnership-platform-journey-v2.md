# Creator Economy User Journey: International Brand Partnership Platform

## What This Person Gets

Sarah finally stops losing sleep over whether their latest campaign in Japan violates local advertising laws, and she can actually tell Fortune 500 clients exactly which creators will work before spending $2M on a campaign. Instead of manually tracking 50,000 creators across 12 platforms and 60 countries, she has a system that automatically finds the right matches and handles all the compliance headaches.

## Quick Reference

- **Persona**: Sarah Chen - VP of Global Partnerships at CreatorBridge International
- **Core Problem**: Managing international creator campaigns manually leads to compliance violations, poor matches, and massive time waste
- **Key Value**: Automated compliance, intelligent creator matching, and real-time global campaign monitoring
- **Success Metric**: 85% campaign success rate with 99% regulatory compliance across 60 countries
- **Priority Level**: High for PRD development

## Persona Profile

### Who They Are

- **Job**: Sarah runs global partnerships for a platform connecting brands with 50,000+ creators across 60 countries, managing $125M in annual campaigns
- **Company**: CreatorBridge International - mid-size creator economy platform competing with AspireIQ and Klear
- **Background**: Former marketing manager at Unilever who moved to creator platforms when she saw brands struggling with international influencer campaigns
- **Tools They Use**: Currently juggling Salesforce, Google Sheets, custom compliance tracking, YouTube Analytics, TikTok Creator Fund data, and way too many email threads

### What's Frustrating Them

- **Compliance Nightmares**: Manually checking if each campaign follows FTC rules in the US, GDPR in Europe, and ASA guidelines in the UK - one mistake costs $500K in fines
- **Bad Creator Matches**: Brands spend $2M on campaigns that flop because the creator's audience doesn't actually align with the brand, and they only find out after it's too late
- **Crisis Management Chaos**: When a creator says something controversial, they have 2 hours to figure out which brands are affected across how many countries before the story goes viral

## Discovery & Evaluation

### Trigger Event

Sarah's team just had their worst quarter ever - a beauty brand campaign in Germany got flagged for GDPR violations, costing them a $300K client and almost getting Sarah fired. She realized their current system of spreadsheets and manual checks can't handle the complexity of international campaigns anymore.

### Evaluation Process

1. **Research Phase**: Sarah heard about Knowledge Graph Lab from a competitor who mentioned they were piloting AI-powered compliance tools. She needs something that actually understands international regulations, not just another campaign management dashboard.

2. **Technical Assessment**: Her CTO needs to know it integrates with their existing Salesforce setup, handles their OAuth flows for 12 different creator platforms, and meets SOC2 requirements for their Fortune 500 clients.

3. **Business Case**: Sarah calculates they're losing $2M annually to failed campaigns and compliance issues. Even a 30% improvement in campaign success rate would pay for the platform twice over.

## Implementation Journey

### Module Requirements

**Backend Requirements:**
- **Data Needs**: Real-time feeds from YouTube, TikTok, Instagram Creator APIs; regulatory databases for 60 countries; brand safety monitoring across 15 languages
- **APIs**: Integration with existing Salesforce CRM, payment processing for 12 currencies, webhook notifications for campaign status changes
- **Performance**: Handle 15,000 concurrent campaigns, sub-2-second response for creator search across 50K profiles, 99.9% uptime during global campaigns
- **Security**: SOC2 compliance, GDPR-compliant data handling, API rate limiting, encrypted storage for creator payment info

**Frontend Requirements:**
- **Workflow Integration**: Dashboard showing campaigns across 24 timezones, drag-and-drop campaign builder, one-click compliance checking for any country
- **Visualizations**: Global campaign performance maps, cultural sentiment analysis charts, real-time crisis monitoring alerts
- **User Interactions**: Advanced creator search with cultural fit scoring, bulk campaign approval workflows, mobile alerts for crisis situations
- **Access Patterns**: Read-only access for brand clients, full editing for Sarah's team, audit trails for compliance reviews

**AI Requirements:**
- **Content Processing**: Analyze creator content for brand safety across 15 languages, detect cultural sensitivity issues, predict campaign performance based on audience overlap
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Map creator audiences to brand demographics, identify emerging cultural trends, extract compliance requirements from legal documents
- **Search Capabilities**: Vector search for creator personality and brand alignment, semantic search for campaign brief matching, filter by cultural compatibility scores
- **Automation Level**: Auto-flag compliance issues (manual review for legal), suggest creator matches (Sarah approves final selection), automated crisis detection with human response

**Publishing Requirements:**
- **Distribution Channels**: Campaign reports via API to client dashboards, Slack notifications for urgent issues, automated compliance documentation
- **Content Formats**: Interactive campaign dashboards, PDF compliance reports, real-time crisis management alerts, mobile notifications
- **Personalization**: Region-specific campaign insights, role-based reporting (legal vs marketing), brand-specific performance metrics
- **Integration**: Direct feeds to client CRM systems, automated invoicing integration, compliance audit trail exports

### Phase 2: Intelligence & Automation (Months 4-6)

Sarah's team starts seeing the platform predict which creator-brand combinations will work before they launch. The AI notices that tech creators in Germany respond better to B2B brands on LinkedIn than consumer brands on Instagram, and starts recommending platform-specific strategies. Crisis management gets automated - when a creator posts something controversial, the system immediately identifies which campaigns are affected and drafts culturally-appropriate response templates.

### Phase 3: Scale & Optimization (Months 7-12)

The platform becomes Sarah's secret weapon for international expansion. When a US fitness brand wants to enter Southeast Asia, the system automatically identifies creators who've successfully worked with similar brands, maps out the regulatory requirements for each country, and predicts ROI based on historical data from similar campaigns. Sarah's team can now manage 3x more campaigns with the same headcount.

## Value Realization
