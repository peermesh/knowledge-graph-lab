# Creator Economy User Journey: Support Organizations Overview

## What This Person Gets

Whether you're giving out grants, fighting for creator rights, or investing in creator tools, you finally get the full picture of what's actually happening in the creator economy. Instead of cobbling together reports from a dozen different sources, you have everything in one place that updates in real time.

## Quick Reference
- **Personas**: Grant officers, policy advocates, and investment partners working in creator economy
- **Core Problem**: Creator economy changes too fast for traditional research to keep up
- **Key Value**: Real-time intelligence that helps make better decisions about supporting creators
- **Success Metric**: Faster, more accurate decisions that actually help creators succeed
- **Priority Level**: High for PRD development

## Persona Profile

### Who They Are

These are three types of people who care about creators but work behind the scenes:

**Grant Officers** work at foundations that give money to creators and creator-focused nonprofits. They spend their days reading applications, trying to figure out which creators actually need help and which projects might work. Most have backgrounds in nonprofit work or program management, but they're not necessarily creator economy experts.

**Policy Advocates** work at organizations fighting for creator rights. They research how platform changes affect creators, write policy papers, and lobby for better laws. They're usually lawyers, policy researchers, or former activists who got into creator issues because they saw how creators were getting screwed.

**Investment Partners** work at VC firms that specifically invest in creator economy companies. They evaluate creator tools, agencies, and platforms all day. Most came from traditional tech investing but had to learn the creator space because it's so different from regular SaaS businesses.

### What's Frustrating Them

**Information is everywhere but nowhere**: Creator economy data is scattered across hundreds of platforms, research reports, and industry newsletters. By the time they piece it together, half of it's already outdated.

**Everything changes constantly**: A platform changes its algorithm, and suddenly thousands of creators are affected. New monetization features launch every week. Policy changes happen faster than they can track. Traditional quarterly reports are useless.

**Hard to measure real impact**: When they fund a creator program or advocate for a policy change, it's nearly impossible to tell if it actually helped. Creator success depends on so many platform-specific factors that traditional metrics don't capture.

## Discovery & Evaluation

### Trigger Event

Usually something big happens that exposes how little they actually know about what's going on. A foundation realizes their latest batch of grants went to creators who were already doing fine, while struggling creators never heard about the program. An advocacy org gets blindsided by a platform policy change that affects thousands of creators overnight. An investment firm passes on a deal that becomes huge because they didn't understand the creator ecosystem well enough.

### Evaluation Process

1. **Research Phase**: They discover Knowledge Graph Lab through industry connections, conference presentations, or recommendations from other organizations dealing with similar challenges.

2. **Technical Assessment**: IT teams evaluate data security, API capabilities, and integration requirements. Legal reviews compliance with grant-making regulations, lobbying disclosure rules, and investment data protection requirements.

3. **Business Case**: Teams calculate ROI based on time savings, better decision quality, and improved outcomes. Usually involves demonstrating value to boards or investment committees.

- Social media management capabilities (they're not running creator accounts)
- Consumer-facing creator discovery tools (they work B2B, not B2C)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Competitive Sensitivity**: Secure data silos with controlled cross-organizational sharing
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in audit trails and compliance monitoring for each organization type
- **Market Dependence**: Diversified data sources to prevent single platform dependency
