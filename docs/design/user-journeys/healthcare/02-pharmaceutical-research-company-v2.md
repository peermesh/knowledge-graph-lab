# Healthcare User Journey: Pharmaceutical Research Company

## What This Person Gets

Maria finally stops missing competitor breakthroughs that could make or break her company's billion-dollar drug pipeline. Instead of manually hunting through thousands of research papers and clinical trials every week, she gets smart alerts when something actually matters to her specific drugs, plus she discovers connections between different disease areas that lead to breakthrough treatments.

## Quick Reference

- **Persona**: Dr. Maria Rodriguez - VP of Clinical Intelligence at mid-size pharma company
- **Core Problem**: Misses critical competitor moves and research insights that cost hundreds of millions in failed drug development
- **Key Value**: Early competitive intelligence and cross-disease research connections that accelerate drug development
- **Success Metric**: 40% improvement in Phase III trial success rates and 18-month faster time to market
- **Priority Level**: High for PRD development

## Persona Profile

### Who They Are

- **Job**: Keeps track of what competitors are doing and finds research insights that help their company develop better drugs faster
- **Company**: Mid-size pharmaceutical company ($840M annual R&D budget) focused on cancer, brain disorders, and rare diseases
- **Background**: Started as a clinical researcher, moved into competitive intelligence because she was good at spotting patterns other people missed
- **Tools They Use**: ClinicalTrials.gov for trial data, PubMed for research papers, expensive Cortellis database for competitor tracking, plus a dozen other specialized tools that don't talk to each other

### What's Frustrating Them

- **Missing competitor breakthroughs**: Found out about a major competitor's drug breakthrough 8 months after it was published, by which time they'd already spent $45M on a similar approach that was now worthless
- **Information overload**: Gets buried under 47,000 new research papers every year but only has time to read 12% of them, meaning they miss important connections between different diseases
- **Slow regulatory updates**: Takes 14 months to incorporate new FDA guidance into their trial designs because nobody has time to track all the changes across different disease areas
- **Siloed research**: Their cancer team discovered something that could help the brain disease team, but nobody realized it for two years because the research lives in different databases

## Discovery & Evaluation

### Trigger Event

Their $200M Alzheimer's drug failed in Phase III trials, and Maria discovered afterward that academic researchers had published warning signs about this exact mechanism 18 months earlier. The CEO asked her to find a way to make sure they never miss critical intelligence again.

### Evaluation Process

1. **Research Phase**: Heard about Knowledge Graph Lab from a colleague at a competitor who mentioned they were using AI to connect research insights across different therapeutic areas
2. **Technical Assessment**: Evaluated whether the platform could handle their strict FDA compliance requirements, integrate with existing clinical databases, and protect their proprietary research data
3. **Business Case**: Calculated that preventing just one Phase III failure would pay for the platform for 5 years, plus the potential upside from faster drug discovery

## Implementation Journey

### Module Requirements

**Backend Requirements:**
- **Data Needs**: Integration with ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, patent databases (USPTO, EPO), FDA submissions, plus their internal clinical trial data and compound libraries
- **APIs**: Must connect to Cortellis, SciBite, ChEMBL, DrugBank, and their internal R&D systems without exposing proprietary data
- **Performance**: Sub-second search across millions of documents, support for 300+ researchers, 99.9% uptime for regulatory deadlines
- **Security**: FDA Part 11 compliance, end-to-end encryption for proprietary data, role-based access controls, complete audit trails for regulatory inspections

**Frontend Requirements:**
- **Workflow Integration**: Dashboard that fits into daily research workflow, alerts that come through existing email/Slack systems, easy export to PowerPoint for executive briefings
- **Visualizations**: Patent landscape maps, clinical trial timeline comparisons, competitive positioning charts, molecular target relationship diagrams
- **User Interactions**: Natural language search for "show me all trials targeting BRAF mutations in brain cancer", ability to save and share custom research queries, bulk export capabilities
- **Access Patterns**: Read-only access for most researchers, edit permissions for senior scientists, admin controls for compliance team

**AI Requirements:**
- **Content Processing**: Extract entities from research papers, patents, clinical protocols, regulatory filings, and internal research reports
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Identify drug mechanisms, biomarkers, patient populations, adverse events, and regulatory pathways across documents
- **Search Capabilities**: Semantic search that understands "EGFR inhibitors" and "epidermal growth factor receptor antagonists" are the same thing, plus vector search for similar molecular structures
- **Automation Level**: Fully automated competitor trial tracking and regulatory guidance monitoring, human-in-the-loop for strategic decisions about pipeline changes

**Publishing Requirements:**
- **Distribution Channels**: Weekly intelligence briefings via email, real-time Slack alerts for urgent competitor moves, API feeds to executive dashboards
- **Content Formats**: PDF reports for regulatory teams, interactive dashboards for researchers, PowerPoint-ready charts for board meetings
- **Personalization**: Different content depth for researchers vs executives, customized alerts based on therapeutic area focus
- **Integration**: Must feed insights into their existing project management tools and regulatory submission systems

### Phase 2: Intelligence & Automation (Months 4-6)

Set up predictive analytics to forecast which competitor drugs are likely to succeed or fail based on early trial data patterns. Add real-world evidence databases to understand how approved drugs actually perform in practice. Build automated patent landscape monitoring that alerts them when competitors file patents in their areas of interest.

### Phase 3: Scale & Optimization (Months 7-12)

Expand to cover all therapeutic areas including rare diseases. Add partnerships with academic institutions to get early access to research findings. Develop their own knowledge sharing agreements with smaller biotech companies to create a broader intelligence network.

## Value Realization

### Initial Value (First Week)

- Gets automated daily briefings about competitor clinical trial milestones instead of manually checking multiple databases
- Finds 23 research papers relevant to their current drug programs that they had missed using their old search methods
- Identifies 3 FDA guidance documents that affect their trial designs that their regulatory team hadn't flagged yet

### Measurable Impact (When ROI Becomes Clear)

By month 8, prevented one Phase III failure by identifying safety signals from competitor data 6 months earlier than their manual process would have caught it. This single save was worth $380M. Also discovered that their CNS depression drug mechanism could work for a specific type of brain cancer, leading to a new $240M development program that's now 18 months ahead of competitors.

### Full Integration (Workflow Adoption)

After 18 months, Maria's team identifies 94% of competitor milestones within 30 days (vs 31% before). They've initiated 23 new drug development programs based on cross-disease insights the platform found. Regulatory submission preparation is 34% faster because they have precedent analysis for similar drugs. The company's overall Phase III success rate improved from 52% to 73%.

## Technical Architecture

### Integration Points
