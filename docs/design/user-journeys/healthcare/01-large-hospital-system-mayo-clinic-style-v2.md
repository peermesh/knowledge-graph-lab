# Healthcare User Journey: Large Hospital System Chief Knowledge Officer

## What This Person Gets

Dr. Sarah Chen finally gets to connect all the brilliant research happening across her hospital system to the doctors actually treating patients. Instead of watching groundbreaking discoveries sit in research papers for years, she can push new treatments to the right doctors within months and see real patients benefit from their work.

## Quick Reference

- **Persona**: Dr. Sarah Chen - Chief Knowledge Officer at large hospital system (Mayo Clinic style)
- **Core Problem**: 180+ research projects creating knowledge that never reaches patient care
- **Key Value**: Connect research discoveries to real patient treatment in months instead of years
- **Success Metric**: Reduce research-to-practice time from 3.2 years to under 12 months
- **Priority Level**: High for PRD development

## Persona Profile

### Who They Are

- **Job**: Oversees how medical knowledge flows through a massive hospital system with 67 locations
- **Company**: Large academic medical center similar to Mayo Clinic with $1.2B Epic EHR investment
- **Background**: Practicing physician who moved into administration because she got frustrated watching good research never help actual patients
- **Tools They Use**: Epic EHR system, scattered research databases, PubMed, UpToDate, plus dozens of specialty systems that don't talk to each other

### What's Frustrating Them

- **Knowledge Stuck in Silos**: Heart breakthrough in Minnesota stays in Minnesota while Arizona patients miss out on better treatment
- **Wasted Research Money**: Spending $47M yearly on duplicate studies because teams don't know what others are working on
- **Slow Patient Impact**: Takes over 3 years for new research to actually change how doctors treat patients
- **Compliance Headaches**: Every new system has to meet HIPAA, HITECH, FDA rules, and state regulations

## Discovery & Evaluation

### Trigger Event

A patient died from complications that could have been prevented using a treatment developed at their own research facility six months earlier. The treating physician had no idea the research even existed. Dr. Chen realized their knowledge management problem was literally costing lives.

### Evaluation Process

1. **Research Phase**: Found Knowledge Graph Lab through medical technology conferences and peer recommendations from other health systems
2. **Technical Assessment**: Required HIPAA compliance, Epic integration, and ability to handle 72,000+ medical diagnostic codes while maintaining patient privacy
3. **Business Case**: Demonstrated potential $159M annual benefit through reduced care variation and faster research adoption

## Implementation Journey

### Module Requirements

**Backend Requirements:**
- **Data Needs**: Integration with Epic EHR, 350,000+ SNOMED clinical terms, real-time PubMed feeds, clinical trial databases
- **APIs**: Epic FHIR APIs, ClinicalTrials.gov integration, National Guideline Clearinghouse connections
- **Performance**: Handle 54,000 concurrent users across 67 locations with sub-2-second response times
- **Security**: AES-256 encryption, HIPAA audit trails, role-based access control, 7-year data retention

**Frontend Requirements:**
- **Workflow Integration**: Knowledge recommendations appear directly in Epic with under 2 clicks to access
- **Visualizations**: Treatment pathway diagrams, outcome comparison charts, research timeline displays
- **User Interactions**: Search by symptoms/conditions, filter by location/specialty, bookmark protocols
- **Access Patterns**: Physicians get full access, residents see approved protocols only, researchers access anonymized data

**AI Requirements:**
- **Content Processing**: Analyze clinical notes, research papers, protocol documents, quality reports
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Link symptoms to treatments, identify research gaps, track outcome patterns
- **Search Capabilities**: Find similar cases, suggest alternative treatments, recommend specialists
- **Automation Level**: Auto-suggest protocols based on patient data, alert teams to new relevant research

**Publishing Requirements:**
- **Distribution Channels**: Push notifications to Epic, email alerts to department heads, dashboard updates
- **Content Formats**: Clinical decision support cards, research summaries, protocol update bulletins
- **Personalization**: Tailor recommendations by specialty, experience level, current caseload
- **Integration**: Connect to Epic order sets, quality reporting systems, research grant databases

### Phase 2: Intelligence & Automation (Months 4-6)

Add predictive analytics to identify which patients might benefit from experimental treatments. Build automated systems to track how new protocols perform and adjust recommendations based on real outcomes.

### Phase 3: Scale & Optimization (Months 7-12)

Roll out to all 67 locations with local customization for state regulations and facility capabilities. Add external partnerships with other health systems to share knowledge while protecting competitive advantages.

## Value Realization

### Initial Value (First Week)

Doctors start seeing relevant research recommendations right in Epic when they're treating similar patients. Specialists get alerts when colleagues at other locations are working on related cases and can collaborate immediately.

### Measurable Impact (When ROI Becomes Clear)

Within 6 months, 89 patients received better treatment plans based on recent research. The system saved $2.3M by avoiding treatments proven ineffective. Specialists got involved 67% faster because the right people were notified automatically.

### Full Integration (Workflow Adoption)

After 18 months, care variation dropped from 23% to 7% across locations. New research findings get implemented in 8.7 months instead of 3.2 years. Patient outcomes improved 16% and the system attracts 28% more complex cases because of their reputation for using cutting-edge treatments.

## Technical Architecture

### Integration Points

- **Data Sources**: Epic EHR FHIR APIs, PubMed real-time feeds, ClinicalTrials.gov, SNOMED CT terminology
- **Security Requirements**: HIPAA compliance, patient de-identification, encrypted data transmission, audit logging
- **Scalability Needs**: Support 54,000 users across 67 locations with 99.9% uptime requirements

### Module Dependencies

- **Backend**: PostgreSQL for structured data, Neo4j for medical knowledge relationships, Redis for real-time caching
- **Frontend**: React-based dashboard integrated with Epic, D3.js for medical pathway visualizations
- **AI**: Natural language processing for clinical notes, vector search for similar cases, automated protocol matching
- **Publishing**: Real-time notifications through Epic, automated email alerts, mobile-responsive dashboards

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs

- Research-to-practice implementation time: Target under 12 months (from 3.2 years)
- Care variation reduction: Target under 10% across all locations (from 23%)
- Patient outcome improvement: Target 15%+ improvement in risk-adjusted quality scores
- Financial ROI: Target 300%+ return within 24 months

### Secondary Metrics

- Physician satisfaction with knowledge tools: Target 90%+ approval
- Research collaboration increase: Track cross-location project partnerships
- Grant funding success: Monitor NIH and pharmaceutical partnership revenue
- Staff retention: Measure specialist turnover reduction

## Anti-Requirements

**What this persona explicitly does NOT need:**
- Consumer-facing patient portals or apps
- Basic electronic health records functionality (they have Epic)
- Simple search tools (they need intelligent knowledge synthesis)
- Generic business intelligence dashboards

## Risk Mitigation

- **HIPAA Compliance**: Built-in patient de-identification and audit trails from day one
- **Epic Integration Failure**: Dedicated Epic-certified integration team and fallback manual workflows
- **Physician Adoption**: Embed recommendations directly in existing workflows rather than requiring new tools
- **Research Resistance**: Start with voluntary pilot programs and demonstrate clear patient benefit cases
