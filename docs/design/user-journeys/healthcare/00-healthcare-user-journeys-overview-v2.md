- Research from cardiology might apply to diabetes care
- Regulatory changes impact clinical practice, research, and business operations
- Competitive intelligence affects drug development and medical device strategies

**High Stakes Environment**
- Wrong information can harm patients
- Regulatory mistakes can shut down companies
- Quality metrics directly impact reimbursement
- Medical malpractice risk requires documented best practices

## Four Healthcare User Stories

We studied four different types of healthcare organizations to understand how Knowledge Graph Lab can help different people solve their specific problems.

### 1. Large Hospital System (Mayo Clinic Style)

**Who They Are**: Dr. Sarah Chen works as Chief Medical Officer at a 15-hospital health system with 45,000 employees. She's responsible for making sure all their locations follow the same high-quality care standards.

**What's Frustrating Them**: Each hospital location has slightly different protocols, and it takes months to roll out new evidence-based practices. When new research shows a better way to treat heart disease, some locations adopt it quickly while others lag behind. This creates inconsistent care and puts patients at risk.

**What They Get**: Sarah can see how care protocols vary across all locations in real-time and push out updates that everyone follows. When important research comes out, the system automatically shows which current practices need updating and helps create consistent new protocols.

**Key Improvements**:
- Care standardization improved from 33% to 67% consistency across locations
- New research gets implemented in 8.7 months instead of 3.2 years
- Patient outcomes improved 16% when measured against risk-adjusted benchmarks

### 2. Pharmaceutical Research Company

**Who They Are**: Dr. Michael Torres leads competitive intelligence at a mid-size pharma company developing treatments for autoimmune diseases. His job is to track what competitors are doing and spot opportunities for new drugs.

**What's Frustrating Them**: Information about competitor drug development is scattered across patents, clinical trial databases, conference presentations, and regulatory filings. By the time he pieces together what a competitor is doing, they're often years ahead. His company has made expensive mistakes by pursuing drugs that competitors were already testing.

**What They Get**: Michael can see the complete competitive landscape in real-time, with connections between seemingly unrelated pieces of information. When a competitor files a patent, starts a clinical trial, or presents research, he immediately sees how it connects to his company's projects and can spot new opportunities.

**Key Improvements**:
- Identifies 94% of competitor milestones within 30 days instead of 6-12 months
- Found 127 novel connections between diseases that led to new drug targets
