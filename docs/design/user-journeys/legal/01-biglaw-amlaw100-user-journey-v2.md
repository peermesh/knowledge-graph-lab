# Legal User Journey: BigLaw Partner and Research Team

## What This Person Gets

Instead of spending days hunting through disconnected databases and hoping they found everything relevant, this partner can ask one smart question and get a complete picture of what their firm already knows about similar cases. Their research team stops doing the same work over and over, and they can actually find the brilliant memo someone wrote three years ago that perfectly addresses their current problem.

## Quick Reference

- **Persona**: Sarah Chen - Senior Partner at 850-lawyer international firm
- **Core Problem**: Critical knowledge trapped in silos across practice groups and offices
- **Key Value**: Firm's collective expertise becomes searchable and usable
- **Success Metric**: 45% reduction in research time for complex matters
- **Priority Level**: High for PRD development

## Persona Profile

### Who They Are

- **Job**: Sarah leads the Securities Litigation practice and manages 15 attorneys handling billion-dollar class actions
- **Company**: AmLaw 100 firm with offices in New York, London, Hong Kong, and six other cities
- **Background**: 18 years at big firms, made partner by being incredibly thorough on research and case strategy
- **Tools They Use**: Westlaw Edge, Lexis+ AI, Bloomberg Law, iManage for documents, Aderant for case management, plus about 8 other specialized platforms

### What's Frustrating Them

- **Knowledge Silos**: The M&A team solved a similar regulatory issue last year but there's no way to find their research without calling around
- **Duplicate Work**: Three different associates are researching the same judicial precedents for different cases right now
- **Information Overload**: Westlaw returns 50,000 results but doesn't know which ones match the firm's preferred arguments
- **Lost Expertise**: When senior associates leave, they take institutional knowledge about judges, opposing counsel strategies, and successful arguments with them

## Discovery & Evaluation

### Trigger Event

Sarah's team spent 80 hours researching a complex securities disclosure issue, only to discover the Corporate team had already done identical work for a different client six months earlier. The client got billed for duplicate work, and Sarah realized their $2M annual research budget was generating massive waste.

### Evaluation Process

1. **Research Phase**: Research librarian identifies Knowledge Graph Lab through legal tech conferences and Westlaw partnership announcements
2. **Technical Assessment**: IT security reviews data handling, API compatibility with iManage and Aderant, and compliance with client confidentiality requirements
3. **Business Case**: CFO approves pilot based on potential 30% reduction in research costs and improved client satisfaction scores

## Implementation Journey

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Months 1-3)

Start with Securities Litigation and M&A groups since they handle the most complex cross-jurisdictional research. Import historical case data and train the system on firm-specific terminology and argument styles. Focus on proving the concept works before expanding.

### Phase 2: Intelligence & Automation (Months 4-6)

Add predictive analytics for case outcomes based on judicial behavior and opposing counsel patterns. Deploy automated research alerts that notify teams when new precedents affect their active cases. Train AI models on firm's successful arguments to suggest strategy improvements.

### Phase 3: Scale & Optimization (Months 7-12)

Roll out to all 850 attorneys across global offices with localized legal systems integration. Add advanced features like competitive intelligence tracking and client development insights. Establish firm-wide knowledge sharing protocols and train all staff on advanced features.

## Value Realization

### Initial Value (First Week)

Research team can immediately find internal work product they never knew existed. Partners stop asking "Has anyone at the firm dealt with this before?" because the system shows them exactly who has and what they learned.

### Measurable Impact (Month 3-6)

- Complex litigation research drops from 40 hours to 22 hours average
- Cross-practice collaboration increases 250% as teams discover relevant expertise
- Brief citation depth improves 35% through better precedent discovery
- $2.8M annual value from billable hour efficiency gains

### Full Integration (Month 12)

Research becomes proactive instead of reactive. The system alerts teams about new developments before they impact cases. Firm's collective knowledge becomes a competitive advantage in client pitches and case strategy. Junior associates develop expertise faster by learning from firm's historical successes.
