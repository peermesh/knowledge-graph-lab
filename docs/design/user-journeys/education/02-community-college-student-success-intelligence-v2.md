# Education User Journey: Community College System Chancellor

## What This Person Gets

Dr. Patricia Martinez finally has a way to see which students are going to struggle before they drop out, and she can actually do something about it. Instead of watching completion rates stay stuck at 39% year after year, she now has tools that help her team intervene early and get students the support they need to graduate.

## Quick Reference

- **Persona**: Dr. Patricia Martinez - Chancellor of 8-campus community college system
- **Core Problem**: Too many students drop out because problems aren't caught early enough
- **Key Value**: Predicting and preventing student failure before it happens
- **Success Metric**: Completion rates improved from 39% to 67% over 24 months
- **Priority Level**: High for PRD development

## Persona Profile

### Who They Are

- **Job**: Runs an 8-campus community college system serving 47,000 students with a $180M budget
- **Company**: Regional community college district in mid-sized metropolitan area
- **Background**: Started as a math professor, worked up through academic affairs and campus administration
- **Tools They Use**: Canvas LMS, multiple student information systems, state reporting databases, budget management software

### What's Frustrating Them

- **Students disappearing**: By the time someone notices a student is struggling, they've already stopped showing up or are too far behind to catch up
- **Scattered information**: Student data lives in different systems across 8 campuses, so nobody has the full picture when someone needs help
- **Limited resources**: Student support staff are overwhelmed and don't know which students need help most urgently
- **State pressure**: Funding is tied to completion rates, and they need to show 15% improvement in 24 months or lose money

## Discovery & Evaluation

### Trigger Event

State education department announced new funding formulas tied directly to student completion rates. Dr. Martinez realized that their current 39% completion rate would cost them $3.2M in funding cuts within two years unless they could dramatically improve outcomes.

### Evaluation Process

1. **Research Phase**: Heard about Knowledge Graph Lab at a national community college conference where another chancellor shared results
2. **Technical Assessment**: IT team evaluated integration requirements with existing Canvas LMS and multiple student information systems
3. **Business Case**: Calculated that losing 3,000 more students per year to dropout would cost more than implementing the platform

## Implementation Journey

### Module Requirements

**Backend Requirements:**
- **Data Needs**: Student records from 8 different SIS platforms, Canvas learning analytics, financial aid data, attendance tracking, employment verification data
- **APIs**: Integration with Ellucian Colleague, Jenzabar systems, federal financial aid databases, state workforce tracking systems
- **Performance**: Real-time alerts for 47,000 students, predictive modeling updates every 24 hours, 99.5% uptime during enrollment periods
- **Security**: FERPA compliance, state data protection requirements, role-based access across 8 campuses

**Frontend Requirements:**

- **Visualizations**: Risk probability charts, completion pathway maps, resource utilization tracking, cross-campus comparison dashboards
- **User Interactions**: Student search and filtering, intervention tracking, outcome measurement, caseload management
- **Access Patterns**: View-only for faculty, edit permissions for advisors and coordinators, full administrative access for campus leadership

**AI Requirements:**
- **Content Processing**: Learning management system activity logs, attendance patterns, assignment completion data, financial aid status changes
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Early warning indicators, successful intervention strategies, optimal resource allocation patterns
- **Search Capabilities**: Find similar student profiles, identify at-risk patterns, locate successful support strategies
- **Automation Level**: Automatic risk scoring updates, predictive modeling, alert generation, resource recommendation

**Publishing Requirements:**
- **Distribution Channels**: Email alerts to advisors, dashboard notifications, weekly summary reports, state compliance reporting
- **Content Formats**: Individual student risk profiles, intervention tracking reports, outcome dashboards, compliance documents
- **Personalization**: Campus-specific metrics, role-based information access, customized alert thresholds
- **Integration**: State reporting systems, Canvas gradebook, financial aid platforms, employer partnership databases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Early Warning System (Months 1-4)

Set up predictive analytics to identify at-risk students before they fail. Connect data from all 8 campuses so student success coordinators can see the full picture and intervene early.

### Phase 2: Intelligence & Automation (Months 4-8)

Add smart recommendations for interventions and automate routine support tasks. System learns which support strategies work best for different types of students and suggests the most effective help.

### Phase 3: Scale & Optimization (Months 7-12)

Expand to include workforce intelligence and transfer pathway optimization. Connect with regional employers and 4-year universities to improve job placement and transfer success rates.

## Value Realization

### Initial Value (First Month)

- Student success coordinators stop missing students who are quietly struggling
- Advisors get automatic alerts when someone needs immediate help
- Campus presidents can see which support services are working and which aren't

### Measurable Impact (Month 6)

- 1,245 high-risk students identified and connected with appropriate support services
- Tutoring referrals increased by 67% with 23% higher success rate
- Financial aid completion time reduced from 3 weeks to 5 days on average

### Full Integration (Month 12)

- Completion rates improved from 39% to 57% system-wide
- Cost per successful student decreased from $4,200 to $2,890
- State funding increased by $2.8M due to improved performance metrics

## Technical Architecture

### Integration Points

- **Data Sources**: Canvas LMS APIs, multiple SIS database connections, federal financial aid systems, state workforce databases
- **Security Requirements**: FERPA compliance, SOC 2 certification, role-based access controls, audit logging
- **Scalability Needs**: Support for 47,000 active students, real-time processing of learning analytics, multi-campus deployment

### Module Dependencies

- **Backend**: PostgreSQL for student records, Neo4j for relationship mapping, real-time data synchronization across systems
- **Frontend**: React-based dashboards with D3.js visualizations, mobile-responsive design for field staff
- **AI**: Machine learning models for risk prediction, natural language processing for intervention notes
- **Publishing**: Automated report generation, customizable alert systems, integration with email and SMS platforms

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs

- Student completion rate improvement (39% to 67% target)
- Early intervention success rate (target 78% for medium-risk students)
- Cost per successful completion reduction (target $1,310 savings per student)
- Time to degree completion improvement (4.2 years to 3.1 years average)

### Secondary Metrics

- Faculty satisfaction with student success tools (target 89%)
- Support service efficiency improvements (target 67% time savings)
- Transfer student success rate (target 94% maintaining good standing)
- Employment placement within 6 months (target 91%)

## Anti-Requirements

**What this persona explicitly does NOT need:**

- Complex research analytics that take weeks to understand
- Student-facing applications that require training
- Integration with systems they don't already use
- Features that require additional staff to operate

## Risk Mitigation

- **Privacy concerns**: Comprehensive FERPA compliance program and transparent data use policies for students
- **Staff resistance**: Extensive training program and demonstration of time-saving benefits before full rollout
- **Technical integration**: Phased implementation starting with most critical systems, backup manual processes during transition
- **Funding dependency**: Business case shows ROI within 18 months, with state funding improvements covering ongoing costs
