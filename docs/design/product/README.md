## What You'll Find Here

When ready, this directory will have:

- **Product Overview** - What we're building and why
- **Technical Architecture** - How the system works
- **User Requirements** - Who uses it and what they need
- **Success Metrics** - How we measure if it's working
- **Module Interfaces** - How the pieces connect
- **Development Roadmap** - What to build when

## In the Meantime

- Module specifications: `/docs/team/modules/`
