# Research Approach

## What is Depth-First Distillation?

Choose one specific example and understand it completely before expanding to patterns. Focus narrow and deep over broad and shallow. Start with real users and concrete workflows to reveal insights that broad surveys miss.

## The Process

Execute these five steps for any domain research:

1. **Pick ONE specific user or use case** - Choose someone real with concrete needs
2. **Map their complete journey in detail** - Document every step, tool, and pain point
3. **Identify patterns from that journey** - Extract repeated problems and emerging needs
4. **Validate patterns with 2-3 more examples** - Confirm others face the same issues
5. **Build solutions for validated patterns** - Create for proven needs, not assumptions

## Research Workflow

Follow this workflow for any research task:

1. **Define the research question** - Specify what decision you need to make
2. **Find a specific example to study** - Pick a real user, company, or case with documented details
3. **Document specific elements of that example** - Capture workflows, tools used, time spent, costs, failures, and pain points
4. **Extract patterns and insights** - Identify themes and repeated problems
5. **Test patterns with more examples** - Find 2-3 similar cases to validate patterns
6. **Write a research summary with confidence levels** - State what you know strongly vs. what needs validation

## Research Prompt Tools

Apply this framework using these operational templates:

**Deep Research Prompt Generator**

- Generate comprehensive research prompts for any domain using structured templates
- Include specific questions about user workflows, pain points, and tool usage
- Structure questions to get actionable insights from AI tools

**Summarization Guidance**

- Consolidate research findings from multiple sources into a single markdown document
- Focus on clarity and decision-readiness over elaborate frameworks
- Use confidence levels to distinguish validated findings from speculation

## Quality Standards

Produce research outputs with these qualities:

- **Specific examples** - Include concrete details and real situations (e.g., "Creator spent 3 hours on Monday searching 15+ brand websites")
- **Validated patterns** - Confirm problems across multiple cases using structured interviews or documentation
- **Confidence levels** - Use labels like "Confirmed" (3+ examples), "Likely" (2 examples), "Hypothesis" (1 example)
- **Actionable insights** - Point directly to what to build with specific feature requirements
- **Missing pieces identified** - Document gaps and unknowns honestly with research plans to fill them

## Getting Started

To apply this approach to your domain:

1. **Choose your first subject** - Pick someone you can study in detail (existing user, documented case study, or interview candidate)
2. **Schedule focused observation** - Block 2-4 hours to map their complete workflow
3. **Document systematically** - Use the 6-step research workflow as your checklist
4. **Extract patterns quickly** - Don't spend more than 1 hour analyzing your first example
5. **Find validation cases** - Identify 2-3 similar subjects within 24 hours
6. **Synthesize with confidence** - Write findings using the quality standards above

Focus on knowing enough to make good decisions. Start with one example, understand it deeply, then expand to validated patterns.
