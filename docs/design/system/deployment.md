# Deployment

Production deployment strategy for Knowledge Graph Lab.

## Deployment Overview

The Knowledge Graph Lab system follows a containerized microservices deployment approach, ensuring scalability, reliability, and maintainability in production environments.

## Prerequisites

### Infrastructure Requirements

The deployment requires modern container orchestration infrastructure with:
- Container runtime environment for service isolation
- Orchestration platform for managing service lifecycles
- Registry services for container image storage
- Load balancing and service mesh capabilities

### Access and Security

Deployment requires appropriate access to:
- Cloud infrastructure services with necessary permissions
- Source code repositories for deployment pipelines
- Production environment configurations
- Secure credential management systems

## Configuration Strategy

### Environment Management

The system uses environment-based configuration to maintain consistency across different deployment stages. Each service maintains its own configuration while sharing common infrastructure settings. This approach enables:

- Service-specific configuration without interdependencies
- Secure credential management through dedicated secret stores
- Environment-specific optimizations (development, staging, production)
- Centralized configuration management for shared resources

## Containerization Strategy

### Service Packaging

Each module is packaged as an independent container, ensuring:
- Isolation between services for stability
- Consistent runtime environments across deployments
- Version management for controlled updates
- Resource allocation boundaries

### Container Registry

The deployment uses a centralized container registry to:
- Store versioned service images
- Enable rollback capabilities
- Support multiple environment deployments
- Maintain deployment history

### Service Orchestration

Container orchestration provides:
- Automated service lifecycle management
- Health monitoring and automatic recovery
- Log aggregation and monitoring
- Coordinated service updates

## Production Orchestration

### Service Deployment

The production environment uses container orchestration to manage:
- Service namespacing for logical separation
- Configuration management across environments
- Secret distribution and rotation
- Rolling deployments with zero downtime

### Deployment Manifests

Deployment configurations define:
- Resource requirements and limits
- Health check parameters
- Scaling policies
- Network policies and service discovery

### Update Strategy

Production updates follow a controlled process:
- Blue-green deployments for critical services
- Rolling updates for stateless services
- Canary deployments for testing new features
- Automatic rollback on failure detection

## Verification and Monitoring

### Health Check Strategy

The system implements comprehensive health monitoring:
- Service-level health endpoints for each module
- Resource utilization tracking
- Application-specific metrics
- End-to-end smoke tests
- Continuous availability monitoring

### Observability Platform

Production observability includes:
- Real-time metrics dashboards
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Distributed tracing for request flows
- Alert management and escalation
- Performance trend analysis

## Rollback and Recovery

### Rollback Strategy

The deployment maintains multiple recovery options:
- Automatic rollback on health check failures
- Manual rollback to previous stable versions
- Revision history tracking for audit trails
- Service-by-service rollback capabilities
- Configuration rollback independent of code

### Database Recovery

Data protection and recovery includes:
- Pre-deployment backup automation
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Separate staging for rollback testing
- Data consistency verification
- Transaction log preservation

### Emergency Response

Emergency procedures provide:
- Rapid service isolation capabilities
- Maintenance mode activation
- Traffic diversion to backup systems
- Incident communication protocols
- Root cause analysis workflows

## Deployment Automation

### Continuous Deployment Pipeline

The system uses automated deployment pipelines that:
- Trigger on code repository changes
- Build and validate service containers
- Execute progressive deployment strategies
- Run automated verification tests
- Monitor deployment health metrics

### Deployment Orchestration

Automated deployment includes:
- Version tagging and tracking
- Multi-service coordination
- Dependency management
- Smoke test execution
- Rollback triggers on failure

### Pipeline Integration

The deployment pipeline integrates with:
- Source control for change tracking
- Container registries for artifact management
- Orchestration platforms for deployment execution
- Monitoring systems for health verification
- Communication channels for status updates

## Troubleshooting Approach

### Diagnostic Strategy

Troubleshooting production issues involves:
- Service health endpoint verification
- Log analysis across service boundaries
- Resource utilization review
- Network connectivity validation
- Configuration consistency checks
