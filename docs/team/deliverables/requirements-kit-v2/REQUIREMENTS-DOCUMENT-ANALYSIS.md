# Requirements Document Analysis: Issues and Process Improvements

- **Document**: `ai-module-spec.md` - Issues Found and Process Recommendations
- **Analysis Date**: 2025-10-12
- **Purpose**: Document issues found in requirements specification and recommend process improvements to prevent future problems

---

## Executive Summary

The AI module requirements document contains several critical issues that originated from the requirements development pipeline rather than the specification content itself. These issues demonstrate systemic problems in the requirements gathering, validation, and review processes that should be addressed upstream to prevent similar issues in future specifications.

## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Template Examples Copied as Actual Requirements

**Problem**: The Technology Constraints section contains requirements that appear to be copied directly from the RequirementsKit template examples rather than being customized for the actual system needs.

**Evidence**:
```markdown
Constraints:
- Must be deployable as Docker container
- Cannot write to local filesystem (use S3 for storage)  ← Template example copied verbatim
- Must run on AWS ECS  ← Template example copied verbatim
```

**Root Cause**: The requirements author copied template examples without customization, treating them as actual system requirements rather than illustrative examples.

**Impact**:
- **Contradictory Requirements**: Docker containers inherently need local filesystem access, but the constraint forbids it
- **Overly Restrictive Deployment**: Forces AWS ECS when standard VPS deployment would be sufficient
- **Implementation Confusion**: Development team must work around impractical constraints

**Process Failure Point**: Requirements validation and review stage failed to catch that template examples were being used as actual requirements.

### Issue 2: Lack of Requirements Validation Against Actual System Needs

**Problem**: The specification includes deployment constraints that don't align with the actual intended deployment approach (Docker containers on standard VPS).

**Evidence**:

- Specification requires AWS ECS deployment
- Specification forbids local filesystem access
- But the stated intent is Docker containers on VPS infrastructure

**Root Cause**: No validation step to ensure requirements match actual deployment intentions and technical feasibility.

**Impact**:
- **Technical Conflicts**: Requirements are mutually exclusive (Docker + no local filesystem)
- **Unnecessary Complexity**: Forces complex cloud infrastructure when simpler VPS would work
- **Development Delays**: Team must either ignore requirements or implement unnecessarily complex solutions

**Process Failure Point**: No technical feasibility review or requirements validation against intended deployment approach.

### Issue 3: Missing Context Validation

**Problem**: The specification lacks context about why certain constraints exist and whether they're actually necessary for this specific system.

**Evidence**:

- "Cannot write to local filesystem" - copied from serverless/email service template
- "Must run on AWS ECS" - copied from cloud-native service template
- No explanation of why these constraints are needed for an AI entity extraction module

**Root Cause**: Requirements were created without sufficient domain knowledge or stakeholder consultation about actual operational needs.

**Impact**:
- **Irrelevant Constraints**: Requirements don't match actual system usage patterns
- **False Assumptions**: Template assumptions applied to different system type
- **Maintenance Burden**: Future teams must work around irrelevant constraints

**Process Failure Point**: Insufficient stakeholder consultation and domain expertise in requirements gathering.

## Process Improvement Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Fix Current Issues)

**1. Requirements Review Workshop**

- Convene stakeholders (developers, operations, product owners)
- Review each constraint for necessity and feasibility
- Document actual deployment intentions and operational requirements
- Replace template examples with real requirements

**2. Technical Feasibility Assessment**

- Have technical team review all constraints for compatibility
- Identify contradictory or overly restrictive requirements
- Validate deployment approach against business needs

**3. Specification Rewrite**

- Rewrite Technology Constraints section with actual requirements
- Include rationale for each constraint
- Ensure all constraints are mutually compatible

### Process Pipeline Improvements

**1. Enhanced RequirementsKit Template**
```markdown
# RequirementsKit Template - Technology Constraints Section

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Customize These Examples

The examples below are ILLUSTRATIVE ONLY. Replace with actual requirements for your system.

**DO NOT copy these examples verbatim** - they may not fit your specific needs.

**Examples (REPLACE WITH ACTUAL REQUIREMENTS):**
- Must be deployable as [your deployment method]
- Must support [your storage requirements]
- Must run on [your target infrastructure]
```

**2. Requirements Validation Checklist**

Add to RequirementsKit process:

```markdown
## Requirements Validation Checklist

Before submitting specification to SpecKit:

### Technical Feasibility
- [ ] All constraints are mutually compatible
- [ ] Deployment requirements match intended infrastructure
- [ ] Storage requirements align with application needs
- [ ] Performance requirements are realistic for target hardware

### Business Alignment
- [ ] All constraints serve actual business needs
- [ ] No unnecessary restrictions that complicate operations
- [ ] Deployment approach supports scalability requirements

### Template Cleanup
- [ ] All template examples replaced with actual requirements
- [ ] No placeholder text or generic constraints remain
- [ ] Each constraint has clear rationale and necessity
```

**3. Multi-Stage Review Process**

**Stage 1: Requirements Author Review**

- Author validates each constraint against actual needs
- Technical team reviews for feasibility
- Business stakeholders review for necessity

**Stage 2: Peer Review**

- Different team member reviews for template contamination
- Cross-functional team validates against domain knowledge
- Technical architect validates compatibility

**Stage 3: Automated Validation**

- Script checks for template example patterns
- Validates constraint compatibility
- Flags overly restrictive or contradictory requirements

**4. Requirements Documentation Standards**

**Each Constraint Must Include:**
- **Necessity Rationale**: Why this constraint is required
- **Technical Justification**: How it supports system operation
- **Business Impact**: What happens if constraint is relaxed
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options evaluated and rejected

**Example (Good Constraint)**:
```markdown
Constraints:
- Must support horizontal scaling for increased processing load
  - Rationale: System must handle 100 concurrent document processing jobs
  - Technical: Docker containers with load balancer support
  - Business Impact: Ensures system can grow with user demand
  - Alternatives: Vertical scaling (rejected due to single point of failure risk)
```

## Specific Fixes for AI Module Specification

### Corrected Technology Constraints
```markdown
Constraints:
- Must be deployable as Docker container
  - Rationale: Enables consistent deployment across environments
  - Technical: Standard containerization for development and production
  - Business Impact: Simplifies deployment and scaling operations

- Must support local filesystem access for temporary processing
  - Rationale: AI processing requires temporary file storage for large documents
  - Technical: Docker volumes for container filesystem access
  - Business Impact: Enables efficient document processing workflows

- Must support deployment on standard VPS infrastructure
  - Rationale: Cost-effective deployment without cloud lock-in
  - Technical: Compatible with major VPS providers (DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.)
  - Business Impact: Reduces operational costs while maintaining flexibility
```

### Process Changes to Prevent Recurrence

**1. Template Modification**

Update RequirementsKit template to clearly distinguish examples from actual requirements:

```markdown
## Technology Constraints (ACTUAL REQUIREMENTS ONLY)

⚠️ IMPORTANT: The examples below are for ILLUSTRATION. Replace with your actual constraints.

**Your Constraints (Replace examples below):**
- [Actual constraint 1]
- [Actual constraint 2]
- [Actual constraint 3]

**Examples (DO NOT USE VERBATIM):**
- Must be deployable as Docker container
- Must support local filesystem access for temporary processing
- Must run on standard VPS infrastructure
```

**2. Automated Detection**

Add script to detect when template examples are used as actual requirements:

```bash
# Check for template contamination
grep -n "Cannot write to local filesystem" $SPEC_FILE && echo "ERROR: Template example found!"
grep -n "Must run on AWS ECS" $SPEC_FILE && echo "ERROR: Template example found!"
```

**3. Requirements Author Training**

Provide clear guidance to requirements authors:

```markdown
## Requirements Author Guidelines

### Before Writing Constraints:
1. **Understand Your System**: What deployment approach will actually be used?
2. **Consult Stakeholders**: What are the real operational requirements?
3. **Validate Feasibility**: Can all constraints coexist technically?

### When Writing Constraints:
1. **Be Specific**: "Must support Docker deployment" not generic examples
2. **Include Rationale**: Explain why each constraint is necessary
3. **Consider Alternatives**: Document why other approaches were rejected

### After Writing Constraints:
1. **Technical Review**: Have developers validate feasibility
2. **Business Review**: Have stakeholders validate necessity
3. **Cross-Check**: Ensure all constraints are mutually compatible
```

## Long-term Process Improvements

### 1. Requirements Quality Gates
- **Gate 1**: Template contamination detection (automated)
- **Gate 2**: Technical feasibility review (developers)
- **Gate 3**: Business necessity review (stakeholders)
- **Gate 4**: Cross-constraint compatibility check (architect)

### 2. Specification Templates Enhancement
- Clear visual separation between examples and actual requirements
- Interactive templates that guide authors through customization
- Built-in validation rules for common mistakes

### 3. Author Support Tools
- Requirements writing guide with domain-specific examples
- Interactive checklist for each specification section
- Peer review templates with specific questions to ask

## Conclusion

The issues in the AI module specification stem from a process failure where template examples were treated as actual requirements without proper customization and validation. This indicates a need for:

1. **Better Template Design**: Clear separation of examples from actual requirements
2. **Enhanced Validation**: Multi-stage review process to catch such issues
3. **Author Training**: Clear guidance on requirements writing best practices
4. **Automated Detection**: Tools to catch template contamination early

These process improvements will prevent similar issues in future specifications and ensure that requirements documents accurately reflect actual system needs rather than template artifacts.
