# Product Requirements Document (PRD) Template

**Module Name**: Backend Architecture
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Owner(s)**: Backend Development Team

---

**Purpose**: This template defines the structure for a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD). Complete all sections below to create a source document ready for SpecKit processing (target: 600-800 lines for comprehensive modules, 300-500 for simpler modules).

**Why this matters**: SpecKit produces dramatically better results when given rich, detailed input that focuses on WHAT (not HOW). This template balances completeness with brevity—providing enough detail for implementation without over-specifying the solution.

**Who should use this**: Developers and module owners preparing functional and technical requirements for their modules (AI, Backend, Frontend, Publishing).

**⚠️ KEY PRINCIPLE**: Describe observable behavior and requirements, not implementation details. The `/plan` command and implementation team handle the HOW.

---

## Important: Length and Detail Guidance

**Comprehensive Spec (Phase 3 - WO-3):**
- Expected: 800-1,500 lines (detailed, implementation-focused)
- Purpose: Provide rich input for quality refinement
- Don't worry about length - capture all necessary detail

**Final Spec (Phase 4 - WO-4):**
- Target: 500-700 lines (refined, requirements-focused)
- Purpose: Implementation-ready PRD matching case study quality
- Achieved by: Removing implementation details, tightening language, eliminating redundancy

**What This Means:**
- It's NORMAL for this template to produce 1,000+ lines initially
- Quality refinement (WO-4) will reduce it to 500-700 lines
- Focus on completeness here, refinement comes later

## Section 1: Problem Statement

### Current Situation

Currently, the system lacks a centralized backend architecture to support knowledge graph operations across multiple integrated modules. The Backend Architecture module must build and maintain foundational systems that support all other modules, but no unified approach exists for database design, API development, authentication, and deployment across the entire system.

The current situation involves fragmented backend services without standardized patterns for API design, database schemas, authentication mechanisms, or deployment strategies. Each module would need to implement these foundational capabilities independently, leading to inconsistent interfaces, duplicated code, security vulnerabilities, and integration challenges. The AI module needs entity extraction APIs, the Frontend module requires REST endpoints, and the Publishing module needs content distribution systems - all without a cohesive backend foundation.

Without this module, the system would experience:
- **Integration failures**: 30-40% of inter-module communication would fail due to inconsistent API contracts
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Authentication and authorization would be implemented inconsistently across modules
- **Performance bottlenecks**: Database queries would lack optimization, causing 500ms+ response times for complex operations
- **Deployment complexity**: Each module would require separate deployment pipelines and infrastructure management
- **Maintenance overhead**: 15-20 hours weekly spent on backend coordination and debugging across module boundaries

### Who is Affected

**Primary Users**: Backend development team (3-5 developers) responsible for implementing and maintaining the core infrastructure that supports all other modules.

**Secondary Users**: All module development teams (AI, Frontend, Publishing) who depend on backend APIs, authentication, and data storage capabilities.

**Scale Expectations**:
- 5,000+ API requests daily from integrated modules
- 10M+ database operations monthly across all entities and relationships
- 1,000+ concurrent users served by the backend infrastructure
- 4 integrated modules requiring consistent backend services
- 24/7 availability requirement for production systems

### Goals

The Backend Architecture module will establish a robust, scalable foundation that enables seamless integration between all system modules while maintaining security, performance, and reliability standards.

**Measurable Outcomes**:
1. **API Performance**: All endpoints respond in under 200ms for 95% of requests, supporting 500+ requests/second
2. **Data Integrity**: Zero data corruption incidents due to authentication or authorization failures
3. **System Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with automated failover capabilities for all backend services
4. **Integration Success**: Successful integration with 3 other modules (AI, Frontend, Publishing) within 30 days of deployment
5. **Query Performance**: Database relationship traversals complete in under 500ms under full production load
6. **Security Compliance**: All authentication and authorization requirements met with zero security incidents in first 90 days

**Business Value**:
- **Reduced Development Time**: 60% reduction in inter-module integration time through standardized APIs and contracts
- **Improved System Reliability**: 80% reduction in production incidents related to backend infrastructure failures
- **Enhanced Security Posture**: Consistent authentication and authorization across all modules eliminates security gaps
- **Scalability Foundation**: Infrastructure supports 10x growth in users and data volume without architectural changes
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Centralized backend management reduces operational overhead by 40%

## Section 6: Implementation Phases (3-5 high-level milestones)

**Purpose**: Identify major delivery milestones - WHAT to deliver, not HOW to build it.

**⚠️ SIMPLIFIED**: This section defines high-level milestones only. The `/plan` command creates detailed implementation phases with tasks and sequences.

**⚠️ NO TIME ESTIMATES**: Focus on deliverables and dependencies, not duration estimates.

### Completeness Guidance

**This section is COMPLETE when it includes:**
- ✅ 3-5 high-level phases (milestones, not day-by-day tasks)
- ✅ Each phase has clear goal (what it achieves)
- ✅ Deliverables are specific and testable per phase
- ✅ Dependencies between phases identified
- ✅ Phases are logically grouped (related deliverables together)
- ✅ MVP-focused sequence (core functionality first)
- ✅ No time estimates or schedules (focus on WHAT not WHEN)

**This section is INCOMPLETE if:**

## Section 7: Edge Cases (10-15 cases, 2-3 lines each)

**Purpose**: Document failure modes, boundary conditions, and unusual situations.

**⚠️ BRIEF FORMAT**: State the situation and expected behavior. Do NOT include implementation details, error handling code, or retry logic specifics.

### Completeness Guidance

**This section is COMPLETE when it includes:**
- ✅ 10-15 edge cases covering main scenarios
- ✅ Each edge case in format "EC-N: [Situation] → [Expected behavior]"
- ✅ Each edge case is 2-3 lines (not 15+ lines with code)
- ✅ Failure scenarios covered (API timeouts, service outages, network errors)
- ✅ Boundary conditions covered (empty data, maximum limits, null values)
- ✅ Concurrency issues covered (simultaneous updates, overlapping jobs)
- ✅ Data quality issues covered (invalid input, malformed data, type mismatches)
- ✅ Edge cases are realistic (not theoretical "what if aliens attack?")

**This section is INCOMPLETE if:**
- ❌ Fewer than 10 edge cases (insufficient coverage)
- ❌ Edge cases include detailed error handling code or retry logic
- ❌ Edge cases exceed 3 lines (too detailed, implementation-focused)
- ❌ Only happy path scenarios (no failure modes documented)
- ❌ Edge cases are too general ("handle errors appropriately")
- ❌ Missing critical scenarios (e.g., external API failure not covered)
- ❌ Edge cases include exception class hierarchies or logging details
- ❌ Vague expected behavior ("do the right thing" instead of specific action)

### Format (REQUIRED):

**EC-[N]**: [Situation] → [Expected behavior]

### What to include:

**Failure Scenarios** - External dependencies fail:
- API timeouts, service outages, network errors

**Boundary Conditions** - Empty or extreme data:
- No matching records, maximum limits reached, null values

**Concurrency Issues** - Race conditions or conflicts:
- Simultaneous updates, overlapping jobs

**Data Quality Issues** - Invalid or malformed data:
- Missing required fields, type mismatches

### What to Include (Requirements Focus):
✅ Situation description (what happens)
✅ Expected behavior (what system does)
✅ 10-15 edge cases covering main scenarios
✅ 2-3 lines per edge case
✅ Failure modes and boundary conditions
✅ Concurrency and data quality issues

### What to Exclude (Implementation Details):
❌ Complete error handling code
❌ Retry logic specifics (exponential backoff algorithms)
❌ Exception class hierarchies
❌ Logging implementation details
❌ Circuit breaker configurations
❌ Detailed recovery procedures

### Level of Detail (Example):

**Good** (requirements-focused):
```
EC-1: SES API timeout → Retry 3x with backoff, mark failed if all attempts fail, alert admin
EC-2: No matching articles for user's tags → Skip user this cycle, log INFO, don't increment schedule
EC-3: User changes interval during processing → Lock row, update takes effect next cycle
EC-4: Article URL returns 404 → Exclude from digest, log WARNING, mark article inactive
EC-5: Email template rendering fails → Use plain text fallback, alert admin
EC-6: Database connection lost → Pause job, retry connection 5x, fail job if persistent
```

**Too detailed** (implementation-focused):
```
EC-1: SES API Timeout Handling
When the AWS SES API times out during email sending:
1. Catch the boto3.exceptions.ReadTimeoutError exception
2. Implement exponential backoff: retry after 1s, 2s, 4s
3. Log each retry attempt with timestamp and error details
4. After 3 failed attempts, mark email as failed in database
5. Update email_queue table: SET status='failed', error_message=...
6. Trigger CloudWatch alarm if failure rate exceeds 5%
7. Send notification to admin via SNS topic
```

---

### Examples

❌ **TOO MUCH** (Implementation details and code):
```
EC-1: SES API Timeout Handling
When the AWS SES API times out during email sending:
1. Catch the boto3.exceptions.ReadTimeoutError exception
2. Implement exponential backoff: retry after 1s, 2s, 4s
3. Log each retry attempt with timestamp and error details
4. After 3 failed attempts, mark email as failed in database
5. Update email_queue table: SET status='failed', error_message=...
6. Trigger CloudWatch alarm if failure rate exceeds 5%
7. Send notification to admin via SNS topic
```

✅ **JUST RIGHT** (Situation → behavior, 2-3 lines):
```
**EC-1**: SES API timeout → Retry 3x with backoff, mark failed if all attempts fail, alert admin
**EC-2**: No matching articles for user's tags → Skip user this cycle, log INFO, don't increment schedule
**EC-3**: User changes interval during processing → Lock row, update takes effect next cycle
**EC-4**: Article URL returns 404 → Exclude from digest, log WARNING, mark article inactive
**EC-5**: Email template rendering fails → Use plain text fallback, alert admin
**EC-6**: Database connection lost → Pause job, retry connection 5x, fail job if persistent
```

## Section 7: Edge Cases

**EC-1**: Database connection pool exhausted during peak load → Queue requests, retry with exponential backoff, alert on-call engineer if persists >5 minutes

**EC-2**: Schema migration fails during deployment → Rollback to previous version automatically, preserve data integrity, notify development team

**EC-3**: API endpoint receives malformed request from AI module → Return HTTP 400 with specific validation errors, log incident for debugging

**EC-4**: JWT token expires during long-running request → Refresh token automatically, retry request with new token, maintain request context

**EC-5**: RabbitMQ broker becomes unavailable → Buffer messages locally, implement circuit breaker, failover to backup broker if configured

**EC-6**: Database query times out on complex relationship traversal → Return partial results with warning, implement query optimization, cache frequent patterns

**EC-7**: Authentication service experiences high latency → Use cached authentication data for known users, fallback to read-only mode, alert security team

**EC-8**: Docker container fails to start in production → Use health check endpoints, automatic restart with backoff, escalate to deployment team if persists

**EC-9**: Integration test environment becomes inconsistent → Reset test database to known state, invalidate affected test results, notify QA team

**EC-10**: Monitoring system loses connectivity → Buffer metrics locally, sync when connection restored, implement redundant monitoring endpoints

**EC-11**: Large entity extraction batch exceeds memory limits → Process in chunks, implement streaming for large datasets, maintain performance targets

**EC-12**: Concurrent relationship creation causes deadlocks → Implement proper transaction ordering, use database-level locking, retry with backoff

**EC-13**: External API rate limit exceeded during processing → Implement intelligent rate limiting, queue requests, retry with exponential backoff

**EC-14**: Database storage reaches capacity limits → Implement data archiving, alert administrators, expand storage automatically

**EC-15**: Authentication token compromised in production → Immediate token revocation, security incident response, audit log analysis
