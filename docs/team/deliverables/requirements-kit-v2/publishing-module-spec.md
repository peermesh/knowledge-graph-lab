# Publishing Tools Module - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Module Name**: Publishing Tools
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Owner(s)**: Publishing Module Specialist

---

**Purpose**: This PRD defines requirements for a comprehensive multi-channel publishing system that delivers insights to users through their preferred channels with intelligent personalization and engagement optimization.

**Why this matters**: Users need insights delivered where they work (email, Slack, Discord) with content personalized to their interests and work patterns. Without this system, valuable insights remain trapped in the platform, reducing user engagement and platform value.

**Who should use this**: Publishing module development team, integration teams (AI, Backend, Frontend), and stakeholders requiring insight delivery capabilities.

---

## Section 1: Problem Statement (85 lines)

**Current Situation**:
The Knowledge Graph Lab platform generates thousands of valuable insights daily through its AI module, extracting entities, building knowledge graphs, and creating research content. However, these insights have no systematic way to reach users through their preferred channels at optimal times. Content creators must manually share insights across platforms, leading to inconsistent delivery, missed opportunities, and underutilization of valuable content.

Users currently must manually check the platform for updates, navigate through scattered information sources, and spend 2-4 hours daily searching for relevant content. This scattered approach results in missed opportunities, information overload from irrelevant content, and frustration with inconsistent delivery timing. Platform usage suffers as users find it easier to rely on external sources rather than the comprehensive insights available within the system.

The platform processes 500-2,000 insights daily across multiple domains (AI, funding, policy, research), but without a publishing system, these insights fail to reach their intended audiences effectively. Users want insights delivered to where they already work with personalization that respects their specific interests and needs, but the current manual approach cannot scale to meet these requirements.

**Who is Affected**:
Primary users include content creators and researchers (50-100 active daily) who need to distribute insights to their professional networks across multiple channels. Platform administrators (2-3 people) manage publishing infrastructure and analytics. End consumers (1,000-5,000 subscribers) receive personalized content through various channels and represent the ultimate beneficiaries of the publishing system.

These users operate in professional environments where time is valuable and information overload is a constant challenge. Content creators work across distributed teams and need reliable multi-channel distribution. Administrators require comprehensive analytics and management tools. End users consume content across different platforms and expect personalized, timely delivery without manual effort.

**Goals**:
The Publishing module will establish a comprehensive publishing infrastructure that delivers insights through multiple channels with intelligent personalization, achieving measurable improvements in user engagement and content utilization. Success means users receive relevant insights when and where they want them, dramatically increasing the platform's value and user engagement while reducing manual content distribution efforts.

Specific targets include delivering insights to 80% of active subscribers within their preferred time windows with 95%+ delivery success rate, achieving 40%+ engagement rate through AI-powered personalization, reducing time-to-publish from 2-4 hours to under 15 minutes per insight, supporting 5+ distribution channels with consistent formatting and branding, and tracking engagement analytics to achieve 60% user satisfaction with content relevance.

## Section 7: Edge Cases (15 cases, 2-3 lines each)

**EC-1**: Email service outage during newsletter send → Queue messages for retry, send admin alerts, maintain delivery status tracking, resume sending when service restored

**EC-2**: Subscriber has invalid preferences (corrupted data) → Use default preferences, log error for admin review, continue processing other subscribers, prevent system failure

**EC-3**: High-priority alert during peak publishing hours → Prioritize real-time alerts over scheduled content, maintain separate queues for different priority levels, ensure critical alerts aren't delayed

**EC-4**: Channel API rate limit exceeded (Slack/Discord) → Implement exponential backoff, queue messages for later delivery, maintain delivery status tracking, alert admins if delays exceed threshold

**EC-5**: Content contains special characters/formatting issues → Sanitize content for each channel's requirements, maintain content integrity across different formatting needs, log formatting issues for template improvement

**EC-6**: User unsubscribes during active newsletter send → Honor unsubscribe immediately, cancel pending deliveries for that user, maintain audit trail of unsubscribe timing and method

**EC-7**: AI module unavailable during content analysis → Use cached personalization data, proceed with publishing using last-known preferences, alert admins, queue content for re-analysis when AI available

**EC-8**: Database connection lost during engagement tracking → Buffer engagement events in memory/Redis, replay events when connection restored, maintain data consistency, prevent data loss

**EC-9**: Template rendering fails for specific content → Use fallback template, log error for template debugging, continue publishing with alternative formatting, maintain delivery schedule

**EC-10**: Concurrent publishing requests for same content → Implement content locking, queue duplicate requests, prevent duplicate deliveries, maintain audit trail of all publishing attempts

**EC-11**: External service authentication expires → Refresh authentication tokens automatically, retry failed requests with new tokens, alert admins if refresh fails after 3 attempts

**EC-12**: User changes preferences during content processing → Apply new preferences to future deliveries, complete current delivery with original preferences, log preference change for audit

**EC-13**: Content exceeds channel size limits (email/Slack) → Truncate content appropriately, add "read more" links, maintain content accessibility, preserve critical information

**EC-14**: Multiple admins modify same template simultaneously → Implement template locking, show "being edited by [user]" status, prevent conflicting changes, maintain version history

**EC-15**: Analytics data volume exceeds storage capacity → Implement data retention policies, archive old data, aggregate historical metrics, maintain query performance for recent data
