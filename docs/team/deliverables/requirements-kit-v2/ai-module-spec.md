## Section 1: Problem Statement

**Current Situation:**
The system currently processes raw documents from multiple sources (news articles, research papers, social posts) but lacks the ability to extract structured knowledge from unstructured text. Content analysts manually read through thousands of documents to identify key entities (organizations, people, funding amounts, dates, locations) and their relationships, spending 4-6 hours daily on this process. This manual approach is time-consuming, error-prone, and scales poorly as document volume increases.

The publishing module can distribute content but lacks contextual understanding for intelligent personalization, resulting in generic content delivery that doesn't leverage entity relationships or content insights. The frontend can display basic search results but cannot provide sophisticated knowledge graph visualizations or relationship-based recommendations, limiting users' ability to discover relevant information and understand complex relationships.

**Who is Affected:**
- **Primary users:** 20-30 content analysts and researchers processing 500-1000 documents weekly across multiple source types
- **Secondary users:** 8-12 publishing team members needing entity data for content personalization and recommendation systems
- **Tertiary users:** 500-2000 frontend users performing 10,000-50,000 entity/relationship queries monthly for competitive intelligence and research
- **Scale expectations:** Process 100-500 documents daily through entity extraction pipeline, generate 10,000-50,000 entities and relationships monthly, support 100-500 concurrent knowledge graph queries

**Goals:**
- Extract 5 core entity types (organizations, people, funding amounts, dates, locations) with 85% precision and 80% recall across document types
- Reduce manual entity identification time from 4-6 hours to under 30 minutes daily per analyst (75% time savings)
- Process 100 documents per hour through the entity extraction pipeline (1000 documents daily capacity)
- Generate knowledge graphs with 80% accuracy for relationship identification (fund, partner, acquire, compete, collaborate)
- Achieve $0.10 average cost per document processed, supporting 500 documents daily within operational budget constraints

**Business Value:**
Implementing the AI module will transform unstructured text into structured knowledge, enabling intelligent content personalization, sophisticated knowledge discovery, and automated relationship mapping. This will reduce manual research time by 75%, improve content relevance for users, and provide competitive intelligence capabilities that currently require extensive manual analysis.

**Total Lines:** 1,287
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Comprehensive specification ready for implementation planning

**Good** (requirements-focused):
```
Current Situation: The system processes raw documents from multiple sources (news articles, research papers, social posts) but lacks the ability to extract structured knowledge from unstructured text. Content analysts manually read through thousands of documents to identify key entities (organizations, people, funding amounts, dates, locations) and their relationships, spending 4-6 hours daily on this process. The publishing module can distribute content but lacks contextual understanding for intelligent personalization. The frontend can display basic search results but cannot provide sophisticated knowledge graph visualizations or relationship-based recommendations.

Who is Affected: 20-30 content analysts and researchers processing 500-1000 documents weekly, 8-12 publishing team members needing entity data for content personalization, and 500-2000 frontend users performing 10,000-50,000 entity/relationship queries monthly.

Goals: Extract 5 core entity types with 85% precision and 80% recall, reduce manual entity identification time by 75%, process 100 documents per hour, generate knowledge graphs with 80% relationship accuracy, and achieve $0.10 average cost per document processed.
```

**Too detailed** (implementation-focused):
```
Current Situation: The company uses Google Sheets (spreadsheet ID: 1a2b3c...)
with 47 columns tracking various metrics. Data is entered using Apps Script
triggers that run every 15 minutes. The sync process involves OAuth2 authentication
with refresh tokens stored in ~/.credentials/. Error rate analysis shows 18.7%
of requests fail due to rate limiting (HTTP 429). We compared 7 project management
tools (Jira, Asana, Linear, ...) with feature matrices and cost projections.

## Section 4: Acceptance Scenarios (3-5 detailed scenarios)

**Purpose**: Show step-by-step execution of key user stories.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: SpecKit expects `Given/When/Then` format for testability. These scenarios should directly validate the acceptance criteria of your User Stories from Section 2.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Keep scenarios brief (15-20 lines max per scenario). Focus on WHAT happens, not HOW it's implemented.

### Completeness Guidance

**This section is COMPLETE when it includes:**

- ✅ Then outcomes are measurable and observable
- ✅ Measurement criteria specified for success
- ✅ Scenarios are brief (15-20 lines max, not 60+ lines with SQL)
- ✅ Scenarios validate acceptance criteria from user stories

**This section is INCOMPLETE if:**
- ❌ Fewer than 3 scenarios (insufficient coverage)
- ❌ Scenarios don't follow Given/When/Then structure
- ❌ Given conditions use placeholders ("[user]") instead of examples ("user@example.com")
- ❌ Scenarios include SQL queries or implementation code
- ❌ Then outcomes are vague ("works correctly") instead of specific ("returns HTTP 200 with user_id field")

## Section 7: Edge Cases (10-15 cases, 2-3 lines each)

**Purpose**: Document failure modes, boundary conditions, and unusual situations.

**⚠️ BRIEF FORMAT**: State the situation and expected behavior. Do NOT include implementation details, error handling code, or retry logic specifics.

### Completeness Guidance

**This section is COMPLETE when it includes:**
- ✅ 10-15 edge cases covering main scenarios
- ✅ Each edge case in format "EC-N: [Situation] → [Expected behavior]"
- ✅ Each edge case is 2-3 lines (not 15+ lines with code)
- ✅ Failure scenarios covered (API timeouts, service outages, network errors)
- ✅ Boundary conditions covered (empty data, maximum limits, null values)
- ✅ Concurrency issues covered (simultaneous updates, overlapping jobs)
- ✅ Data quality issues covered (invalid input, malformed data, type mismatches)
- ✅ Edge cases are realistic (not theoretical "what if aliens attack?")

**This section is INCOMPLETE if:**
- ❌ Fewer than 10 edge cases (insufficient coverage)
- ❌ Edge cases include detailed error handling code or retry logic
- ❌ Edge cases exceed 3 lines (too detailed, implementation-focused)
- ❌ Only happy path scenarios (no failure modes documented)
- ❌ Edge cases are too general ("handle errors appropriately")
- ❌ Missing critical scenarios (e.g., external API failure not covered)
- ❌ Edge cases include exception class hierarchies or logging details
- ❌ Vague expected behavior ("do the right thing" instead of specific action)

### AI Module Edge Cases:

**EC-1**: LLM API rate limit exceeded during processing → Queue job for retry with exponential backoff, switch to fallback model provider if available

**EC-2**: Document contains mixed languages (English + Chinese) → Process each language section separately, combine results with language metadata for downstream processing

**EC-3**: Entity extraction model returns low confidence (<70%) for critical entities → Flag for manual review, continue processing non-critical entities, log for model retraining

**EC-4**: Vector database connectivity lost during similarity search → Fall back to PostgreSQL-based search, queue vector operations for retry when connectivity restored

**EC-5**: Document processing job times out after 5 minutes → Cancel job, log timeout reason, retry once with simplified processing pipeline

**EC-6**: Multiple similar entities detected (company name variations) → Apply deduplication rules, merge entities with confidence-weighted properties, maintain all name variations

**EC-7**: Relationship extraction identifies contradictory information → Store all relationship claims with source attribution, flag conflicts for manual resolution

**EC-8**: Knowledge graph update creates circular reference → Detect cycles during validation, break cycle by removing weakest confidence edge, log for review

**EC-9**: Memory usage spikes during large document processing → Implement chunked processing with memory limits, spill to disk if needed, monitor and alert on memory patterns

**EC-10**: Entity extraction API costs exceed daily budget → Switch to lighter/cheaper models for remaining capacity, queue high-cost documents for next day processing

**EC-11**: Empty document submitted for processing → Return appropriate error response, log empty document event, no entities extracted

**EC-12**: Document contains only special characters and symbols → Process through entity extraction, handle gracefully with appropriate confidence scores, avoid crashes

**EC-13**: Concurrent users submit identical entity queries → Cache frequently requested entity lookups, return cached results within 100ms, update cache on entity changes

**EC-14**: Vector embedding generation fails for specific entity types → Use fallback embedding strategy, flag entity for manual embedding assignment, continue processing

**EC-15**: Knowledge graph reaches maximum node/edge limits → Implement pagination for large result sets, provide partial results with continuation tokens, alert administrators

### What to include:

**Failure Scenarios** - External dependencies fail:
- API timeouts, service outages, network errors

**Boundary Conditions** - Empty or extreme data:
- No matching records, maximum limits reached, null values

**Concurrency Issues** - Race conditions or conflicts:
- Simultaneous updates, overlapping jobs

**Data Quality Issues** - Invalid or malformed data:
- Missing required fields, type mismatches

### What to Include (Requirements Focus):
✅ Situation description (what happens)
✅ Expected behavior (what system does)
✅ 10-15 edge cases covering main scenarios
✅ 2-3 lines per edge case
✅ Failure modes and boundary conditions
✅ Concurrency and data quality issues

### What to Exclude (Implementation Details):
❌ Complete error handling code
❌ Retry logic specifics (exponential backoff algorithms)
❌ Exception class hierarchies
❌ Logging implementation details
❌ Circuit breaker configurations
❌ Detailed recovery procedures

### Level of Detail (Example):

**Good** (requirements-focused):
```
EC-1: SES API timeout → Retry 3x with backoff, mark failed if all attempts fail, alert admin
EC-2: No matching articles for user's tags → Skip user this cycle, log INFO, don't increment schedule
EC-3: User changes interval during processing → Lock row, update takes effect next cycle
EC-4: Article URL returns 404 → Exclude from digest, log WARNING, mark article inactive
EC-5: Email template rendering fails → Use plain text fallback, alert admin
EC-6: Database connection lost → Pause job, retry connection 5x, fail job if persistent
```

**Too detailed** (implementation-focused):
```
EC-1: SES API Timeout Handling
When the AWS SES API times out during email sending:
1. Catch the boto3.exceptions.ReadTimeoutError exception
2. Implement exponential backoff: retry after 1s, 2s, 4s
3. Log each retry attempt with timestamp and error details
4. After 3 failed attempts, mark email as failed in database
5. Update email_queue table: SET status='failed', error_message=...
6. Trigger CloudWatch alarm if failure rate exceeds 5%
7. Send notification to admin via SNS topic
```

---

### Examples

❌ **TOO MUCH** (Implementation details and code):
```
EC-1: SES API Timeout Handling
When the AWS SES API times out during email sending:
1. Catch the boto3.exceptions.ReadTimeoutError exception
2. Implement exponential backoff: retry after 1s, 2s, 4s
3. Log each retry attempt with timestamp and error details
4. After 3 failed attempts, mark email as failed in database
5. Update email_queue table: SET status='failed', error_message=...
6. Trigger CloudWatch alarm if failure rate exceeds 5%
7. Send notification to admin via SNS topic
```

✅ **JUST RIGHT** (Situation → behavior, 2-3 lines):
```
**EC-1**: SES API timeout → Retry 3x with backoff, mark failed if all attempts fail, alert admin
**EC-2**: No matching articles for user's tags → Skip user this cycle, log INFO, don't increment schedule
**EC-3**: User changes interval during processing → Lock row, update takes effect next cycle
**EC-4**: Article URL returns 404 → Exclude from digest, log WARNING, mark article inactive
**EC-5**: Email template rendering fails → Use plain text fallback, alert admin
**EC-6**: Database connection lost → Pause job, retry connection 5x, fail job if persistent
```
