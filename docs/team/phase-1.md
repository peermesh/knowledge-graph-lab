# Phase 1: Research & Discovery

**Current Phase** | Due: Friday 5:00 PM

---

## Objectives

Research and select technologies for your module that will:
- Meet project requirements
- Integrate with other modules
- Be implementable in remaining timeline
- Run locally in Docker

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Research Brief (2 pages max)
- Technology comparison matrix
- Selected approach with rationale
- Risk assessment
- Implementation plan

### 2. Key Decisions Document
- Database choices (if applicable)
- Framework selection
- Library dependencies
- Integration approach

### 3. Questions & Concerns
- Technical blockers
- Integration uncertainties
- Resource needs
- Timeline risks

---

## Quick Links to Your Research

Jump directly to your module's research assignment:
- [Backend Architecture Research](/docs/modules/backend-architecture/assignments/phase-1/Backend-Architecture_Phase-1_Research.md)
- [Frontend Design Research](/docs/modules/frontend-design/assignments/phase-1/Frontend-Design_Phase-1_Research.md)
- [AI Development Research](/docs/modules/ai-development/assignments/phase-1/AI-Development_Phase-1_Research.md)
- [Publishing Tools Research](/docs/modules/publishing-tools/assignments/phase-1/Publishing-Tools_Phase-1_Research.md)

## Research Focus by Module

### Backend Architecture
- Docker containerization strategy
- Database selection (PostgreSQL, Redis, Vector DB)
- API framework (FastAPI, Express, etc.)
- Authentication approach

### Frontend Design  
- React framework and tooling
- Graph visualization libraries
- Component library selection
- State management approach

### AI Development
- LLM integration strategy (OpenAI, Anthropic, open source)
- Vector database for embeddings
- Knowledge graph construction approach
- Cost optimization strategies

### Publishing Tools
- Email service providers
- Multi-channel distribution tools
- Content transformation libraries
- Analytics platforms

## Research Resources

### Use These Tools
- AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity)
- [Research Prompts](/docs/research/prompts/)
- Previous research in `/docs/ai/artifacts/`
- Module-specific resources in your README

### Evaluation Criteria
1. **Feasibility**: Can we build this in 10 weeks?
2. **Cost**: Will it run on student budgets?
3. **Integration**: Does it work with other modules?
4. **Scalability**: Can it grow beyond MVP?
5. **Learning**: Will you gain valuable skills?

## Submission Process

1. **Create** your research brief
2. **Save** to `/docs/modules/[your-module]/deliverables/research/`
3. **Name** as `phase-1-research-brief.md`
4. **Submit** via pull request
5. **Notify** in Discord when complete

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Clear technology recommendation  
✅ Rationale backed by research  
✅ Integration points identified  
✅ Risks acknowledged  
✅ Submitted by Friday 5pm

---

## Common Pitfalls

❌ Over-engineering for Phase 1  
❌ Choosing tech you can't implement  
❌ Ignoring integration requirements  
❌ Missing Docker compatibility  
❌ No cost consideration

---

## Questions?

- **Technical**: Ask in #kgl-[your-module]
- **Integration**: Discuss in #kgl-integration  
- **Process**: Check with @grig
- **Examples**: See `/docs/ai/artifacts/`
