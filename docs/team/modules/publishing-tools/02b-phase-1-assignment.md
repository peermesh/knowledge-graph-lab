## Your Focus Area

You'll be building the distribution and engagement layer of the Knowledge Graph Lab, creating systems that transform research insights into personalized, multi-channel content experiences. Your work will determine how users consume and interact with the intelligence our platform generates.

---

## Research Philosophy: Depth-First Distillation

Your research should explore the full spectrum of publishing technology - from basic email APIs to how established platforms personalize content for large audiences, how publishing platforms handle thousands of content creators, and how major news organizations deliver millions of notifications daily. Understanding these enterprise-scale operations will inform your architectural decisions, even if your initial implementation is simpler.

**Research Approach:**
Document the full spectrum of solutions - from basic email APIs to enterprise-scale systems. Understanding how companies like Morning Brew, Substack, and The New York Times handle publishing at scale will inform your architectural decisions.
