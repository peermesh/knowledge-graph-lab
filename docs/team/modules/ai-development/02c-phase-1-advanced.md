# AI Development Phase 1 Deep Dive

‚Üê Back to [Phase 1 Overview](02a-phase-1-overview.md)

**Purpose**: This document provides advanced AI/ML research topics that extend beyond Phase 1 requirements. Use these resources to deepen understanding of knowledge graph systems, retrieval-augmented generation, and enterprise AI architectures. The topics here inform long-term technical decisions and help build expertise for Phases 2-3.

## Advanced Retrieval Patterns

These patterns go beyond basic RAG implementations. Research these if you have time after completing Phase 1 requirements.

### Enhanced Retrieval Methods

- **Re-ranking**: Uses cross-encoders to re-score initial retrieval results for accuracy
- **Multi-hop Retrieval**: Answers complex questions by chaining multiple lookups together
- **Graph RAG**: Enhances vector retrieval with knowledge graph relationships for context
- **Self-RAG**: System self-reflects on retrieval quality and reruns if needed
- **CRAG (Corrective RAG)**: Detects and corrects retrieval failures automatically
- **HyDE**: Generates hypothetical documents to improve embedding match quality

### Production Systems Worth Studying
