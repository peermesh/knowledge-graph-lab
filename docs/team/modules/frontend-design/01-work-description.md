## üöÄ Getting Started

### Phase 1 Focus
1. Review visualization requirements in `assignments/phase-1/`
2. Set up React development environment
3. Evaluate component libraries
4. Create initial graph visualization prototype
5. Design authentication flow UI

### Key Resources
- **Research Assignment**: `/docs/modules/frontend-design/assignments/phase-1/Frontend-Design_Phase-1_Research.md`
- **D3.js Gallery**: [Observable D3 Gallery](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery)
- **React Patterns**: [patterns.dev](https://patterns.dev)
- **Accessibility Guide**: [WebAIM](https://webaim.org)

## üèóÔ∏è Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **User-First**: Every decision starts with user needs
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex data revealed gradually
3. **Responsive by Default**: Mobile-first, works everywhere
4. **Accessible Always**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
5. **Performance Matters**: 60fps animations, fast interactions

### Research Focus Areas
- **Graph Libraries**: D3.js vs Cytoscape.js vs Sigma.js vs Force-graph
- **Component Systems**: Material-UI vs Ant Design vs build custom
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit vs Zustand vs Jotai vs Context
- **Build Tools**: Vite vs Next.js vs Create React App
- **Testing**: Jest + RTL vs Vitest vs Cypress vs Playwright
- **Styling**: CSS Modules vs Styled Components vs Tailwind
- **Data Fetching**: React Query vs SWR vs Apollo Client

## üìö Learning Path

**Graph Visualization:**
- Start with D3.js basics
- Learn force-directed layouts
- Study interaction patterns
- Explore WebGL options (three.js)

**React Advanced Patterns:**
- Custom hooks
- Render props
- Compound components
- Performance optimization

**Design Systems:**
- Component composition
- Theme architecture
- Design tokens
- Documentation practices

**Accessibility:**
- Screen reader testing
- Keyboard navigation
- Color contrast
- ARIA patterns

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-engineering visualizations**: Start simple, enhance gradually
2. **Ignoring mobile users**: Test on real devices early
3. **Poor graph performance**: Limit nodes, use virtualization
4. **Accessibility afterthought**: Build it in from the start
5. **State management chaos**: Plan data flow early
6. **Bundle size bloat**: Monitor and optimize continuously

## üìû Communication Channels

- **Primary**: Slack #frontend-design
- **Design Reviews**: Figma comments
- **Daily Standups**: 10 AM via Discord
- **Code Reviews**: GitHub Pull Requests
- **UI/UX Questions**: Office hours Mon/Wed
