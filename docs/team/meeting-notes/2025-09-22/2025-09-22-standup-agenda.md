# Phase 1 Research Review Stand-Up Agenda
- **Date**: September 22, 2025
- **Duration**: 45 minutes

## ðŸ’¡ Quick Reminder: We're Here to Help
**Team note:** If you encounter a blocker, please reach out to @grigb right away. No need to struggle alone - let's solve it together!

### Sharing What You Need
When reaching out about a blocker, it's helpful to include:

1. **What you're trying to find or build** - the specific piece you need
2. **Which module should provide it** - your best guess on the source
3. **How you expect it to work** - the format or structure you're anticipating
4. **Your current approach** - what you've attempted or assumed so far
5. **What would unblock you** - the specific help or decision you need

### Navigating Our Integration Phase
As we connect our modules, remember:

- **Mock data keeps you moving** - create placeholders when needed
- **Document your thinking** - note your assumptions for the team
- **Build adaptable interfaces** - we'll iterate as we learn
- **Communicate often** - share expectations with other modules early

Questions we're all figuring out together:

- How will our APIs communicate?
- What's the best authentication flow?
- Which events should trigger updates?
- Where should different data types live?
- How do we handle cross-module errors gracefully?

2. Find commits since [LAST_MEETING_DATE]
3. Click commits to see Browse files or Files changed

### B) Pull Requests
Search filters:

- Merged: `is:pr is:merged merged:>=YYYY-MM-DD sort:updated-desc`
- Open: `is:pr is:open updated:>=YYYY-MM-DD sort:updated-desc`
- By author: add `author:github-username`

### C) Issues & Decisions
Filter by:

- Decisions: `label:decision updated:>=YYYY-MM-DD`
