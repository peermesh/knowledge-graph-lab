# Phase 1 Research Review Sheet - Team Standup
- **Date**: September 22, 2025
- **Purpose**: Review Phase 1 research assignments and progress

---

## üí° Quick Note: Getting Help When You Need It
**Hey team!** If you hit a blocker, please reach out to @grigb right away - no need to wait for our next meeting. We're here to help you move forward.

### How to Describe What You Need
When you're stuck, it helps to share:

1. **What you're looking for** - the specific data, interface, or connection point
2. **Where it should come from** - which module or teammate might have this
3. **The format you're expecting** - how the data should be structured
4. **What you've already tried** - your current approach or assumptions
5. **What would help you move forward** - the decision or info that would unblock you

### Working Through the Unknown Together
Since we're still connecting our modules, here's our approach:

- **Mock data is your friend** - create placeholder data to keep moving
- **Document your assumptions** - future-you will thank you
- **Design flexible interfaces** - we'll refine them as we go
- **Over-communicate** - share your expectations early with other modules

Common questions we're all working through:

- What will our API responses look like?
- How should authentication flow between modules?
- Which events should trigger cross-module updates?
- Where should different types of data live?
- How do we gracefully handle errors between modules?
