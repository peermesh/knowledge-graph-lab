## What's Your Pet Project?

**The Idea:** Share something you're passionate about or want to achieve - and see how the Knowledge Graph Lab can help you discover what you need

**Two Ways to Share:**
1. **Goals & Aspirations** - "I want to be a successful artist" + what's holding you back
2. **Personal Fascinations** - "I'm fascinated by Formula 1 but never have time to dive deep"

**Example:** Struggling artist → System finds grants with deadlines, residency programs, artist communities

**See:** [Your Personal Discovery Guide](../../../../.dev/_sprint_nov9/meeting-exercise-goal-driven-discovery.md) - Understand the system from your own perspective

## Next Steps & Action Items

### Critical: Docker Container Commits

**Goal:** Get best attempt at Docker versions of modules committed to repository

**Why This Matters:**
- Once modules are committed, we can review something concrete
- Enables concrete planning for next phase
- Iterate on problems together

**Expected State:**
- Some modules (0-4) will have Docker containers running
- Some will have problems - that's expected
- We'll iterate on problems together
- Focus on problems worth working on

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Commit Docker container work to repository
- [ ] Push to remote branch
- [ ] Document any known issues/problems
- [ ] Be ready to demo what you have (even if incomplete)

---

## MVP Production Work

**After modules are committed:**
- Review committed Docker containers
- Identify problems worth working on
- Plan iterations and fixes
- Make concrete plans for next phase

**GitHub Issue Tracking:**
- Once first-level modules are in the system, we'll start using GitHub for tracking individual issues
- This will begin as we move into MVP production work phase
- Issues will track specific tasks, bugs, and improvements

---

## Project Systems & Infrastructure Updates

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Design kit refinement process - [Refinement Summary](../../../../.dev/_sprint_nov9/design-kit-refinement-process-summary.md)
- ✅ Interface distillation (Primary Screens - Stages 1 & 2) - [Primary Screens Distillation](../../../../.dev/_sprint_nov9/interface-distillation-primary-screens/)
- ✅ Goal-driven discovery exercise framework
- ✅ Agents directory infrastructure (sharing system)
- ✅ Meeting preparation (documentation, handouts, exercises)
- ✅ Content organization (migration planning, structure)

**Purpose:** Project oversight, seamless coordination, reusable systems, team workflow support

**See:** [Meeting Summary](../../../../.dev/_sprint_nov9/MEETING-SUMMARY.md) for complete details
