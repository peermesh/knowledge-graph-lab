```
```

## Query Commands

Support these queries:

- "Show all outstanding work orders" → Display outstanding section
- "Show blocked work" → Display blocked section
- "Show work by priority" → Group by priority
- "Show oldest work orders" → Sort by age
- "Show work order dependencies" → Display relationship graph

## Maintenance Rules

1. **Never delete entries** - Move completed to archive
2. **Update status immediately** when work order changes
3. **Track all WOs** - Including those from previous sessions
4. **Age calculation** - Days since creation
5. **Relationship tracking** - Update blocks/blocked-by

## Archive Location

Completed work orders older than 7 days move to:
`.dev/ai/workorders/WO-ARCHIVE.md`

## Integration Points

- **With Handoffs:** Pull outstanding WO list from here
- **With Proposals:** Add generated WOs here
- **With Tracking:** Reference this in project tracking
- **With Reviews:** Update effectiveness scores here
- **With Accomplishments:** Auto-create accomplishment entries when WOs complete
- **With Changelogs:** Link to detailed change documentation

## Index Update Command

```bash
# After any WO status change
echo "Updated WO-xxx status to COMPLETED" >> .dev/ai/workorders/WO-CHANGELOG.md
# Update index
[Update the WO-INDEX.md file]
# Track change
~/.agents/scripts/track-project.sh "[project]" "WO Index updated" "[change summary]" "[agent]" "update index"

# If status changed to COMPLETED, create accomplishment entry
if [[ "$NEW_STATUS" == "COMPLETED" ]]; then
  ~/.agents/scripts/create-accomplishment.sh "WO-xxx Title" "Feature Implementation" "WO-xxx" "[agent]"
  echo "Created accomplishment entry for completed WO-xxx"
fi
```
