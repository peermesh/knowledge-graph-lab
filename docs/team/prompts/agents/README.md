# 🤖 Specialized Agent Directory

This directory contains specialized AI agents designed for specific domains and workflows. Each agent is optimized for particular types of tasks and can be invoked through various AI platforms and tools.

## 🚀 How to Use Agents

### **In Claude Code & Cursor**
Agents are designed to work within coding environments where you can invoke specialized capabilities:

```bash
# Invoke via task tool (recommended for complex work)
<task>agent-orchestrator: Design multi-agent workflow for project launch</task>

# Direct agent invocation
Use agent-orchestrator for coordinating complex projects
```

### **In Chat Interfaces (Claude, Gemini, Codex)**
For conversational use, reference the specific agent by name and provide context:

```
"I need the agent-research-analysis to investigate microservices architecture options"
"Use agent-dev-general-contractor to audit this code for production readiness"
```
