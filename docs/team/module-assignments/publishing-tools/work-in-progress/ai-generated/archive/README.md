# Archived Files - Old Single-Document Format

**Date archived:** 2025-10-09

**Reason:** Replaced by dual-output format

## What's here

### 2025-10-09-distilled-ben-conversation.md (558 lines)
**Created:** 2025-10-08 20:01

**Format:** Single-document prose extraction

**Problems:** 

- Dense prose format (hard to scan)
- Decisions buried in paragraphs
- Not optimized for human review or PRD generation
- No actionable structure for junior developers

**What worked:**

- Extraction discipline (no invention)
- Quote preservation
- MVP vs. post-MVP separation

**Replaced by:** Dual-output format (2 files per conversation)

- `2025-10-09-publishing-decisions-agreements.md` (326 lines - scannable tables)
- `2025-10-09-publishing-implementation-guide.md` (771 lines - actionable tasks with provenance)

## Format Evolution

**Old approach:** Single document trying to serve all audiences

- PRD generation agents
- Human synthesis reviewers
- Junior developers needing implementation guidance

**New approach:** Two documents, two purposes

- **Document 1: Decisions & Agreements** - Scannable extraction with tables/cards, 300-500 lines
- **Document 2: Implementation Guide** - Actionable tasks with provenance markers (‚úì ‚ö†Ô∏è üî¥ üü° ü§ñ üë§), 400-600 lines

## Why Preserved

These files represent the learning process - valuable for understanding:

- What problems the dual-output format solved
- Evolution from dense prose to scannable structure
- Anti-patterns to avoid in future distillations

**See parent directory for current dual-output methodology.**
