## Technical Decisions

### Decision: Docker Containerization

**What:** Publishing module will be a standalone Docker container

**Why:** Enable modular development and deployment, allow independent scaling and connection to other PeerMesh components

**Alternatives Considered:** Not discussed

**Critical Quote:**
> "The module itself will be a Docker container with just your part of the work in. And when we're done, we're going to be connecting that to the other Docker containers."

**Status:** ‚úì Confirmed

---

### Decision: JSON Format for User Requests

**What:** User preferences and publication requests stored as JSON

**Why:** Structured data format for managing settings, suitable for database storage and API communication

**Alternatives Considered:** Not discussed

**Critical Quote:**
> "the pipeline starts with the sort of sets of instructions in probably JSON file format, where it's, you know, the details about the user and the request"

**Status:** ‚úì Confirmed

---

### Decision: File-Based Email Assembly (Not In-Memory)

**What:** Assemble emails using temporary files on disk, not in-memory processing

**Why:** Reduce server RAM requirements, enable handling larger content without memory constraints

**Alternatives Considered:** In-memory processing (explicitly rejected)

**Critical Quote:**
> "I think this is the way to do it because you don't want to do this all in memory because that means that the server has to have a larger amount of RAM in it."

**Status:** ‚úì Confirmed

---

### Decision: AWS Simple Email Service (SES)

**What:** Use Amazon SES for email dispatch

**Why:** Not explicitly discussed

**Alternatives Considered:** Not discussed

**Critical Quote:**
> "when it was sent to the location to be emailed out, in this case, SES by Amazon, the simple email service"

**Status:** ‚úì Confirmed

---

### Decision: Shortcode Template System

**What:** Templates use shortcodes (placeholders) for dynamic content insertion

**Why:** Avoid hard-coding, enable flexible formatting without code changes

**Alternatives Considered:** Hard-coded content (mentioned as anti-pattern)

**Critical Quote:**
> "using shortcodes, which is a way of saying insert the user's first name or insert their last name or something like that. So you can kind of choose the formatting in the template instead of it being hard-coded somewhere."

**Status:** ‚úì Confirmed

---

### Decision: Dynamic Page Rendering (On-Demand, Not Static)

**What:** Render "show more" web pages dynamically when user requests, don't pre-save HTML

**Why:** Save storage (avoid duplicating content), allow template changes to apply retroactively, easier customization

**Alternatives Considered:** Static pre-rendered pages (rejected due to storage and maintenance issues)

**Critical Quote:**
> "we may want to do something where that page is actually rendered when they open it... because there's no point in saving these pages fully rendered as well as the, you know, chunks... because it doubles the amount of space required"

**Status:** ‚úì Confirmed

---

### Decision: Two-Template Minimum for MVP

**What:** Implement at least two different email templates

**Why:** Test interchangeability, validate templating system architecture

**Alternatives Considered:** Single template (rejected)

**Critical Quote:**
> "I've found if you do something where you have at least two of something that's supposed to be interchangeable, you can check to make sure it really works for more than the one thing."

**Status:** ‚úì Confirmed

## Open Questions

| # | Question | Impact | Priority | Who Can Answer | Context from Conversation |
|---|----------|--------|----------|----------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | What is the exact schema for AI-generated articles? (fields, metadata, images) | Blocker | üî¥ | AI module owner | "It'll probably just be like a markdown file" - format mentioned but structure undefined |
| 2 | What is the max email content size before truncation? (200 words? other limit?) | High | üü° | Product/compliance | "if you've got an article that's hundreds of pages long, you just want the first paragraph or... 200 words or something" - approximate, not firm |
| 3 | What is the exact doPublish() trigger mechanism and call frequency? | Blocker | üî¥ | Core module/backend | "server will say something like, publish all current, like do publish will be the call" - behavior described, implementation undefined |
| 4 | What are storage limits and garbage collection thresholds? | High | üü° | Infrastructure/cost | "we'll have to do some math on how many markdown files... we can store on a system before it's not economically viable" - identified need, no specifics |
| 5 | What authentication/authorization is required between modules? | Blocker | üî¥ | Security/backend | Not discussed - inferred as standard microservices requirement |
| 6 | What is the database query API for fetching unpublished content by user tags? | Blocker | üî¥ | Database module owner | "we're going to make a request to the other database for any available stuff that matches those tags" - concept clear, API undefined |
| 7 | What is the unsubscribe page design and confirmation API contract? | Medium | üü° | Frontend/UX + backend | "take them to a page that says... this is what you asked for. Remember, are you sure" - flow described, implementation not detailed |
| 8 | Do we support multi-user subscriptions (friends sharing feed)? | Low | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Product owner | "it might be cool if you could like create your own list of people that receive it with you. I don't know like how that would work" - uncertain if in scope |
| 9 | What email HTML markup language/standard should we use? | Medium | üü° | Email specialist | "I think there's a markup language for emails. Did you... run into that or not" - identified as consideration, not resolved |
| 10 | What is minimum viable dashboard for email management? | Medium | üü° | Product + engineering | "we could do a round of research on what that is. Like what's the minimum requirements?" - research task identified |
| 11 | What error handling and retry logic for failed email dispatch? | High | üü° | System architect | Not discussed - inferred as critical for production reliability |

---

## Critical Quotes

### Legal: Unsubscribe Requirement

**Context:** Explicit legal compliance mandate for email system

> "to be compliant with law, we should have the unsubscribe button, the link there, which means anyone who's had enough can click a button to unsubscribe"

**Implications:** Unsubscribe flow is MVP requirement, not optional. Must implement: button in email ‚Üí confirmation page ‚Üí backend state update ‚Üí respect preference in future sends.

---

### Vision: Quality Standards - "Rubber Hits the Road"

**Context:** Sets quality bar for template rendering and visual output

> "That's where us as humans will have to look at it and make a lot of tweaks and changes to make it look good and look professional. That's where the rubber hits the road, as they say."

**Implications:** Template rendering quality is critical success factor, not just functional checkbox. Expect iterative refinement phase. Visual output quality = system value perception.

---

### Technical: Template Interchangeability Test

**Context:** Rationale for two-template minimum in MVP

> "I've found if you do something where you have at least two of something that's supposed to be interchangeable, you can check to make sure it really works for more than the one thing."

**Implications:** MVP MUST include two templates (suggested: plain text + formatted with images/colors) to validate templating system architecture. Single template = untested design.

---

### Scope: Notifications Explicitly Deferred

**Context:** Clear priority: email first, mobile later

> "The notification thing might be like a little, is an API call to something that like actually has access to the mobile device. That's a nice to have, let's just say for now."

**Implications:** Push notifications OUT of MVP. Email publishing is the core focus. Mobile can be added later with same rendering logic (different dispatch target).

---

### Technical: Memory vs. File Architecture

**Context:** Core architectural decision for server efficiency

> "I think this is the way to do it because you don't want to do this all in memory because that means that the server has to have a larger amount of RAM in it."

**Implications:** Architecture pattern: use temporary files, not in-memory buffers. Trade-off: lower RAM requirements for higher I/O operations. Design for disk-based assembly.

---

### Vision: Email Publishing Systems Are Valuable and Complex

**Context:** Real-world validation of problem domain significance

> "I had a buddy who in 2026, I think, was hired into this secret team... building the email publishing system for Nest... And now he's a self-made millionaire living in New Zealand"

**Implications:** Email publishing at scale is complex, deep problem space. Don't underestimate scope. Nest invested heavily in this - expect hidden complexity. Value proposition is proven.

---

### Scope: Research Email Standards - Explicit Task

**Context:** Identified research prerequisite before detailed implementation

> "we'll probably need to do some research on what these email publishing tools have in terms of the full suite of things... what's the minimum requirements? And what are these like large systems doing for sending like millions of emails?"

**Implications:** Research task is part of MVP work. Need to understand: minimum compliance requirements, scale considerations, industry standards. Don't reinvent wheel - learn from established systems.

---

### Vision: Feedback Loop and Content Relevance

**Context:** Long-term value of user interaction data for AI improvement

> "the more we get from the user about their interests the curating of the work, we're understanding the user. We're also understanding the space in general, right?"

**Implications:** System isn't just one-way publishing - it's a feedback loop. User interactions (clicks, saves, preferences) inform AI content generation. Long-term: improve relevance, build knowledge graph of user-topic-content relationships.

---

### How to Resolve Integration Contract TBDs

**When you see üî¥ TBD (No Schema Defined):**

**What it means:** Integration mentioned in conversation but no schema/contract discussed

**Resolution process:**
1. **Review conversation context** (see "Known Structure" column and related Open Questions)
2. **Identify decision maker** (see "Who Can Answer" in Open Questions)
3. **Gather requirements:**
   - What data flows in? (see "Needs From Them" column)
   - What data flows out? (see "Provides To Them" column)
   - What's the interaction pattern? (API call, event trigger, polling?)
4. **Define minimal schema** covering discussed use cases
5. **Document in integration contract design doc**
6. **Update this document:** Change üî¥ TBD ‚Üí ‚úì Defined, add schema reference

**Example: AI Module Integration Resolution**

**Before (üî¥ TBD):**
```
| **AI Module** | Formatted articles | User queries | üî¥ TBD | "markdown file" mentioned, no schema |
```

**After resolution (‚úì Defined):**
```
| **AI Module** | Formatted articles | User queries | ‚úì Defined | Schema: docs/integrations/ai-article-schema.json - Fields: article_id, title, content_markdown, summary, url, tags[], image_url (optional) |
```

**Resolution artifacts created:**
- `docs/integrations/ai-article-schema.json` - Full JSON schema
- `docs/integrations/ai-module-contract.md` - Integration contract doc
- Updated Integration Contracts table in this document

---

**When you see ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial (Some Structure Known):**

**What it means:** Conversation discussed some structure but details incomplete

**IMPORTANT:** Check the "Known Structure" column - don't ignore this!

**Resolution process:**
1. **Start with known structure** (extract from Known Structure column)
2. **Identify gaps** (see "Unknown/TBD" column or Open Questions)
3. **Fill gaps through:**
   - Follow-up conversation with module owner
   - Review existing similar integrations
   - Technical research (industry standards, library documentation)
4. **Document complete schema**
5. **Update status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial ‚Üí ‚úì Defined

**Example: Core Module Integration Resolution**

**What we know (from conversation):**
- State flags: "in progress", "published"
- JSON format for user requests
- doPublish() trigger method exists

**What's unknown:**
- Exact JSON schema fields
- Trigger timing/frequency
- Error state handling

**Resolution action:**
1. Use known state flags as starting point
2. Design JSON schema around "user request" concept mentioned
3. Prototype doPublish() signature based on described behavior
4. Validate with backend team
5. Document complete contract

---

### How to Prioritize and Resolve Open Questions

**Resolution Order (by Priority):**

**1Ô∏è‚É£ All üî¥ Blockers First** (Implementation cannot proceed)
- These block multiple phases of development
- Usually integration schemas, auth mechanisms, core architectural decisions
- **Action:** Schedule resolution meetings ASAP, assign DRIs (Directly Responsible Individuals)

**2Ô∏è‚É£ üü° Important Next** (Affects design but has workarounds)
- Can stub these initially but need real answers before production
- Examples: Storage limits, email size thresholds, error retry logic
- **Action:** Document workaround approach, add to technical debt log

**3Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ö†Ô∏è Nice-to-Know Last** (Optimization or edge cases)
- Doesn't block MVP implementation
- Can be addressed in post-MVP iterations
- **Action:** Add to backlog, prioritize after MVP launch

**Resolution Workflow:**

For each Open Question:
1. **Check "Who Can Answer"** column ‚Üí Contact that person/team
2. **Review "Context from Conversation"** ‚Üí Understand what triggered the question
3. **Determine resolution type:**
   - **Technical decision:** Architecture/design session
   - **Product decision:** Stakeholder alignment meeting
   - **Research needed:** Spike/investigation task
4. **Document decision** in appropriate section:
   - Technical Decisions (if architectural choice)
   - MVP Features (if scope clarification)
   - Integration Contracts (if schema definition)
5. **Update Open Questions:** Mark as ‚úÖ Resolved with reference to where documented

---

### How to Address Identified Gaps

**Gaps are categorized by urgency. Treat each category differently:**

**üî¥ Blockers (Cannot Implement Without):**

**What they are:** Missing architectural decisions, undefined contracts, fundamental unknowns

**Resolution approach:**
- **Technical design session** with engineering team
- **Stakeholder alignment** for product decisions
- **Document in:** Integration contracts, technical design docs, architectural decision records (ADRs)

**Example gaps from this document:**
- AI article schema definition ‚Üí Integration contract needed (Open Question #1)
- Authentication between modules ‚Üí Security design doc needed (Open Question #5)
- Database query API contract ‚Üí Backend API spec needed (Open Question #6)

**Timeline:** Resolve before Phase 1 implementation starts

---

**üü° Likely Needed (High Probability Required):**

**What they are:** Production requirements not discussed but standard for this system type

**Resolution approach:**
- **Engineering team discussion** on approach
- **Industry best practices research** (how do similar systems handle this?)
- **Document in:** Non-functional requirements, system design, deployment guide

**Example gaps from this document:**
- Error handling and retry logic ‚Üí Standard microservices pattern (Open Question #11)
- Storage limits and cleanup policy ‚Üí Capacity planning doc (Open Question #4)
- Rate limiting and throttling ‚Üí API gateway configuration

**Timeline:** Resolve during implementation phases (can stub initially)

---

**‚ö†Ô∏è Standard Practices (Industry-Standard Requirements):**

**What they are:** Assumed requirements for production systems (logging, monitoring, backups, etc.)

**Resolution approach:**
- **Reference architecture patterns** from similar projects
- **Existing implementation review** (what do we already do for other modules?)
- **Document in:** Operational runbook, deployment guide, monitoring setup

**Example gaps from this document:**
- Logging and monitoring ‚Üí Adopt project-wide observability standards
- Backup and disaster recovery ‚Üí Use existing backup infrastructure
- Configuration management ‚Üí Standard environment variable approach
- Health checks ‚Üí Docker orchestration standard

**Timeline:** Address during DevOps/deployment setup (not blocking development)
