### Critical Path Overview

**Dependency Flow:**

1. **Phase 0: Foundation** ‚Üí Docker setup, learn email standards, project structure
2. **Phase 1: Core Pipeline** ‚Üí Request ingestion, file assembly, basic dispatch (depends on Phase 0)
3. **Phase 2: Email Publishing** ‚Üí SES integration, error handling (depends on Phase 1)
4. **Phase 3: Template System** ‚Üí Two templates, shortcodes, rendering (depends on Phase 1)
5. **Phase 4: Integration** ‚Üí Connect to AI/DB modules, end-to-end testing (depends on all previous)

**Blockers to Watch:**

- üî¥ AI article schema - Blocks Phase 1 (file assembly needs schema) - Doc 1 Open Question #1
- üî¥ Database query API - Blocks Phase 1 & 4 (content retrieval, integration) - Doc 1 Open Question #6
- üî¥ doPublish() trigger mechanism - Blocks Phase 1 (pipeline entry point) - Doc 1 Open Question #3
- üî¥ Frontend request data schema - Blocks Phase 1 & 4 (user preferences, integration) - Doc 1 Gap

## Implementation Readiness Matrix

**Purpose:** Quick scan of which phases can start vs. blocked

| Phase | Can Start? | Blockers | Dependencies | Confidence |
|-------|------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Phase 0: Foundation** | ‚úÖ Yes | None | None | **High** - Mostly standard setup and research |
| **Phase 1: Core Pipeline** | ‚ùå No | - AI schema (OQ #1)<br>- doPublish() spec (OQ #3)<br>- DB API (OQ #6)<br>- Frontend schema (Gap) | Phase 0 | **Low** - 4 critical blockers unresolved |
| **Phase 2: Email Publishing** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | - SES setup (dependency)<br>- Some error handling details (OQ #11) | Phase 0, Phase 1 | **Medium** - SES can be configured, but depends on Phase 1 |
| **Phase 3: Template System** | ‚úÖ Yes | None | Phase 0 | **High** - Templating approach confirmed, no blockers |
| **Phase 4: Integration** | ‚ùå No | - All Phase 1 blockers<br>- Auth mechanism (OQ #5) | All prior phases | **Low** - Cannot integrate until contracts defined |

**Key Takeaways:**

- ‚úÖ **Can start immediately:** Phase 0 (Foundation & Learning), Phase 3 (Template System in parallel)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Requires planning:** Phase 2 (Email Publishing) can be partially designed but needs Phase 1 complete
- ‚ùå **Fully blocked:** Phase 1 (Core Pipeline), Phase 4 (Integration) - resolve Document 1 Open Questions first

**Recommended Sequence:**

1. Start Phase 0 immediately (no blockers)
2. Work on Phase 3 templates in parallel (independent of Phase 1)
3. Resolve all üî¥ blockers (Open Questions #1, #3, #5, #6, Frontend schema)
4. Begin Phase 1 (unblocked)
5. Follow with Phase 2, then Phase 4

**Time:** 1-2 hours

---

## Phase 1: Core Pipeline - Request to Assembly

**Goal:** Build foundational publishing pipeline from trigger to assembled output files

**Time Estimate:** 12-16 hours

**Provenance Summary:**

- ‚úì Extracted: 6 tasks (doPublish(), request parsing, content retrieval, file assembly from Doc 1)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Inferred: 4 tasks (validation, error handling, edge cases - standard practice)

- JSON format: Document 1 Technical Decision #2
- State flags: Document 1 Integration Contracts notes ("in progress", "published")

**Implementation Notes:**

- Request JSON contains: user preferences, topics, frequency, delivery methods (from Doc 1 Integration Contracts)
- State update must persist to database (API TBD - see Doc 1 Open Question #6)
- Interval logic: "do publish method knows the interval that it's going to be called at" - need to handle timing

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Method accepts trigger input (format TBD)
- [ ] Successfully parses JSON request data
- [ ] Updates request status to "in-progress"
- [ ] Logs entry in dispatch log

---

### P1.2: Content Retrieval üî¥ BLOCKED

- AI article format: Document 1 Open Question #1 - "markdown file" mentioned but structure undefined

**Implementation Notes:**

- Tracking "already sent" items: mechanism mentioned but not detailed
- Article format: "probably just be like a markdown file" - assume markdown text, but metadata/images unknown

**Blockers:**

- üî¥ Database query API contract undefined (Reference: Document 1 Open Question #6)
- üî¥ AI article schema undefined (Reference: Document 1 Open Question #1)
- **Impact:** Cannot implement until both blockers resolved
- **Resolution needed before:** Phase 1 start

**Success Criteria:**

- Memory constraint: Doc 1 Critical Quote - "don't want to do this all in memory because that means that the server has to have a larger amount of RAM"

**Could ask agent:** üìã **Copy-paste ready**

"Implement a file assembly system that copies AI article files to a temporary folder structure organized by publish job ID. Include cleanup logic to delete temp files after successful dispatch or on failure. Use Node.js fs module with async/await."

**Expected output:**

- Module: `src/fileAssembly.js` with functions: `createTempFolder(jobId)`, `copyArticles(jobId, articles[])`, `cleanup(jobId, success)`
- Temp folder pattern: `/temp/[jobId]/` with article files inside
- Error handling for file I/O failures
- Cleanup function called from Phase 2 dispatch success/failure

**Validation checklist:**

- [ ] Temp folder created with unique ID: `/temp/job-12345/`
- [ ] Articles copied successfully to temp location
- [ ] Cleanup removes folder after success
- [ ] Cleanup removes folder after error
- [ ] No memory leaks (check with multiple runs)

**Implementation Notes:**

- Temp folder location: consider using `/temp/[job-id]/` pattern
- Cleanup timing: after dispatch complete (Phase 2) or on error

**Provenance:**

- Truncation: Document 1 Open Question #2: "if you've got an article that's hundreds of pages long, you just want the first paragraph or... 200 words or something"
- Show more link: Doc 1 - "then so if something's larger than 200 words, we'll have a click here for more button"
- HTML conversion: Inferred (emails need HTML, markdown mentioned as source)

**Implementation Notes:**

- Truncation limit: ~200 words suggested but NOT finalized (see Doc 1 Open Question #2)
- "Show more" links to dynamically rendered page (Doc 1 Tech Decision #6)
- Email HTML standards: research from P0.2 should inform approach

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Articles truncated at configured limit

- Shortcodes: Doc 1 - "anything that's like custom code or custom text to not be hard coded, right? That's a basic requirement of a templating system"

**Implementation Notes:**

- Two templates required (plain text + formatted) - from Doc 1 Critical Quote about interchangeability
- Shortcodes needed: user first name, last name, article blocks, unsubscribe link (inferred)
- Template location: `/templates/` directory from P0.3

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Template loaded successfully

- [ ] Capture send response ‚ö†Ô∏è Inferred
- [ ] Handle SES errors (quota, bounce, invalid email) ‚ö†Ô∏è Inferred

**Provenance:**

- SES usage: Document 1 Technical Decision #4 - "SES by Amazon, the simple email service"
- Error responses: Document 1 Gap - "The email one's also got... the potential be bounced back. So that needs to be added to the log"

**Could ask agent:** üìã **Copy-paste ready**

"Implement AWS SES email sending in Node.js. Use AWS SDK to send HTML emails with error handling for: quota exceeded, bounced emails, invalid addresses. Return detailed response object with message ID and status. Include retry logic for transient failures."

**Expected output:**

- Module: `src/emailDispatch.js` with function: `sendEmail(to, from, subject, htmlBody, textBody)`
- AWS SDK v3 (@aws-sdk/client-ses) integration
- Error handling for: QuotaExceededException, MessageRejected, InvalidParameterValue

- Log contents: Document 1 - "That dispatch log will also have the details of the whole pipeline from the moment it was requested, the moment it entered the system... the moment it was processed, what logic was used for processing, what templates were used... when it was sent"
- Per-request logs: Doc 1 - "each log entry is specific to that one request to that one API"

**Implementation Notes:**

- Log must track: entire pipeline (request ‚Üí process ‚Üí template ‚Üí dispatch)
- Include: templates used, processing logic version, SES response
- Future: handle post-dispatch updates (bounces, unsubscribes) - see Doc 1 Gaps

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Log entry created for every dispatch
- [ ] Contains all pipeline details
- [ ] Persisted to database
- [ ] Linked to request record

- [ ] Implement shortcode replacement logic ‚úì Extracted (shortcode system from Doc 1 Tech Decision #5)
- [ ] Handle missing data gracefully ‚ö†Ô∏è Inferred

**Provenance:**

- Shortcode system: Document 1 Technical Decision #5 - "using shortcodes, which is a way of saying insert the user's first name... anything that's like custom code or custom text to not be hard coded"

**Could ask agent:** üìã **Copy-paste ready**

"Create a template engine for email publishing that supports shortcodes like {{first_name}}, {{article_content}}, {{unsubscribe_link}}. Use Mustache.js or similar. Include error handling for missing data (fallback to empty or default). Support nested content blocks for article lists."

**Expected output:**

- Module: `src/templateEngine.js` with function: `renderTemplate(templatePath, data)`
- Library: Mustache.js (or Handlebars.js) integration

- [ ] Shortcodes replaced correctly with provided data
- [ ] Missing data doesn't crash (defaults to empty/fallback)
- [ ] Nested article blocks render correctly (loop through array)
- [ ] Errors logged for debugging

**Learning trade-off:** Low (templating is common pattern - agent saves 1-2 hours)

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Shortcodes correctly replaced
- [ ] Missing data handled
- [ ] Supports nested blocks (article lists)
- [ ] Template errors logged

**Time:** 1-2 hours

- [ ] Define shortcodes needed ‚ö†Ô∏è Inferred
- [ ] Add unsubscribe section ‚úì Extracted (legal requirement from Doc 1 Critical Quote)
- [ ] Test readability ‚ö†Ô∏è Inferred

**Provenance:**

- Two templates required: Document 1 Critical Quote - "I've found if you do something where you have at least two of something that's supposed to be interchangeable, you can check to make sure it really works for more than the one thing"
- Unsubscribe: Document 1 Critical Quote - "to be compliant with law, we should have the unsubscribe button"

**Why human:** Design decisions (layout, tone, readability) require judgment and UX thinking

**Implementation Notes:**

## Automation Opportunities

**How to Use This Section:**

- Tasks marked ü§ñ Agent-ready in phases above can be delegated
- Below are high-value automation targets with example prompts
- Consider learning trade-offs before delegating

### High-Value Automations (High Time Savings, Low Learning Loss)

#### P0.1: Docker Environment Setup

**Time Savings:** 1-2 hours

**Learning Trade-off:** Low (routine setup, one-time task)

**Could ask agent:**

"Create a Dockerfile for a Node.js publishing module that will run as part of a microservices architecture. Include environment variables for AWS SES credentials and database connection. Also create a docker-compose.yml for local development with volume mounts for code."

**Why automate:** Boilerplate configuration, standard Docker patterns

**What to review:** Environment variable naming, port mappings, volume paths

---

#### P0.3: Project Structure Creation

**Time Savings:** 30-45 min

**Learning Trade-off:** Low (standard project scaffolding)

**Could ask agent:**

"Create a Node.js project structure for an email publishing module. Include directories for: email templates, temporary file assembly, dispatch logs. Initialize package.json with dependencies: nodemailer (AWS SES), mustache (templating), and standard utilities. Create a README with setup instructions."

**Why automate:** Routine scaffolding, saves manual setup time

**What to review:** Directory names match Phase requirements, dependencies correct

---

#### P1.3: Temporary File Assembly

**Time Savings:** 1-2 hours

**Learning Trade-off:** Low (standard file operations)

**Could ask agent:**

"Implement a file assembly system that copies AI article files to a temporary folder structure organized by publish job ID. Include cleanup logic to delete temp files after successful dispatch or on failure. Use Node.js fs module with async/await."

**Why automate:** Routine file operations, standard patterns

**What to review:** Cleanup logic correctness, error handling

---

#### P2.2: AWS SES Dispatch

**Time Savings:** 2-3 hours

**Learning Trade-off:** Medium (SES integration is learned skill, but boilerplate heavy)

**Could ask agent:**

"Implement AWS SES email sending in Node.js. Use AWS SDK to send HTML emails with error handling for: quota exceeded, bounced emails, invalid addresses. Return detailed response object with message ID and status. Include retry logic for transient failures."

**Why automate:** Well-defined integration, AWS SDK boilerplate

**What to review:** Error handling completeness, retry logic correctness, credential security

---

#### P3.1: Template Engine Implementation

**Time Savings:** 1-2 hours

**Learning Trade-off:** Low (common templating pattern)

**Could ask agent:**

"Create a template engine for email publishing that supports shortcodes like {{first_name}}, {{article_content}}, {{unsubscribe_link}}. Use Mustache.js or similar. Include error handling for missing data (fallback to empty or default). Support nested content blocks for article lists."

**Why automate:** Standard templating implementation, library-based

**What to review:** Shortcode syntax matches requirements, error handling

---

### Do NOT Automate (üë§ Human-design tasks)

- **P0.2: Email Publishing Standards Research** - Requires synthesis, judgment, compliance understanding
- **P0.4: AWS SES Account Setup** - Security decisions, account access, cost implications
- **P3.2: Plain Text Template** - Design, tone, readability require human judgment
- **P3.3: Formatted HTML Template** - Visual design, brand consistency, "where the rubber hits the road" per Doc 1
- **P4.2: Unsubscribe Flow Implementation** - Legal compliance, UX flow, critical business logic

---
