# Spark of an idea conversation
**concepts and flow, not implementation details**

So basically we're building this publishing tool and that's your, the module you're building. The module itself will be a Docker container with just your part of the work in. And when we're done, we're going to be connecting that to the other Docker containers. And that's what makes it part of PeerMesh is that you're able to like use these modular parts and connect them. So we're building the foundation of the PeerMesh publishing tools. And so there's, that's kind of like the big picture, like the way that we're going to connect this part of the work with the rest of the work. And the tool, the module needs to be able to take inputs from the other parts of the system. So the front end has an interface for choosing where you're publishing, what you're publishing, and that gets sent to the backend for stored into a database for each user. And then this module, the publishing module, will then ask for the data from the database through the core main module, you know, what is it that we need to publish? And so there's this management of the stuff that's being published that will happen once all the modules are connected. And obviously that hasn't that isn't there yet. So we have to have this kind of understanding of what your starting input is going to be. Like the basic like pipeline of going from, you know, instructions on what to publish to things getting pushed out to the web through email. Maybe we can get to push notifications or text messages. I think that'd be super cool. Or like if you could get a little thing on your phone that said your stuff is now published or here's the publication, you can tap on that notification and it takes you to a web page version of the thing that's published. I think so that interface has worked out. We have a way for on the front end to save the user's requests, which are things like give me everything about the creator economy and open source. and I'm interested in the recent news in Boulder, including events. And I'm interested in open source projects that are distributed systems or something like that. And so that's the stuff that's being stored into the database. And then we have to figure out how to turn that into stuff that's happening in our pipeline, in the publishing pipeline. So the pipeline starts with the sort of sets of instructions in probably JSON file format, where it's, you know, the details about the user and the request. And then it goes from those requests to our managed system, where we have to figure out where the final content is. And the AI module has had a chance by this point to also review these requests. So its job was to gather the data. It's like constantly gathering data on the internet and building up this wealth of information. And then when a user asks for something, the AI gets a notification and one of its processes will actually write an article for us. And that article will be like a well-formatted article. It may or may not have images associated with it at that point. Probably not. It'll probably just be like a markdown file. So we have two sets of things. We have the user's request data, and then we'll have another database with all the formalized things we're going to send. So in that request one, we'll also have things like, I want an email every week. I want you to post on Instagram every day. You know, that kind of thing. We'll have to figure out exactly which things we're going to target. I was thinking actually what might make more sense than Instagram posts for this would be a publishing tool that publishes to blog platforms. um, sub stack or Patreon or something like that through their API. So you could like create like this, like newsfeed, um, that was auto published. And then you could, uh, pretty much like create like hyper focused content for an individual's interest. So you could have some crazy niche of that. Nobody, you know, maybe a hundred people in the world are interested in. Um, but you would end up with their with this page that had just that group of people's uh focus interests so that that could be good and then the emails sounds like a good one for sure um and then the the notifications to your phone either like just push notifications telling them that their content's ready or actual content like in their messages so you get like a um like a a brief of what's happening that week on the things that you're focused on um in as as a text message so um that that's kind of i think our target for what we're publishing and uh so what we'll have is a system that is triggered by an event, right, will have some sort of main method that's called by the server. And the server will say something like, publish all current, like do publish will be the call. And when do publish is called, it will see what needs to be published that's like in this window that hasn't been published yet and needs to be published before the next time it's called. So like that do publish method knows the interval that it's going to be called at. So it could be like, well, I'm supposed to send this guy something every week. It's been six days. The next time I'll be called is tomorrow. So I'll wait till tomorrow. Right. So it has to have a little bit of logic about how often it's called to decide when to make the call. And then if once it's decided that now it's time to make, now it's time to publish something, it will take that data from the data, the request from the user, and change the flag on that data to, I'm working on it or in progress. And it will then run through and actually do the main body of the work. At the end of the main body of the work, it will set the flag in that data to published. Okay? So that's like, now we're in the main body of the work part, which will be the part where we're actually doing the active publishing flow. Like this will be the main logic. And we'll probably have to work on like exactly how to break this down into something that makes sense. But it'll be something like, we basically have this access to the same data. We'll be asking for the user's data, and that will be a list of things that they're interested in. And then we're going to make a request to the other database for any available stuff that matches those tags that isn't in the list of things we've already sent them. So we don't want to send them last week's stuff. And so we have to track the intervals that we send stuff and what we've sent. So there'll be some tracking of that stuff. And I think we should probably attach that to the same data from the user's request. So I'm thinking of this for the first time. But the user's request data is going to evolve over time to the point where it's got all of the information. We'll be able to audit it at any moment and be like, okay, did they get it? What did they get? was it received? So when we get messages back from these various systems that say the email bounced back or like the API call didn't work or whatever kind of messages, that'll all go in there as well. So we'll have this one source of truth per request per user that we update as we do it. And from there, we'll probably need to consolidate the files. We really want to be wary of the amount of space these things take up. I'm not quite sure. You know, we'll have to do some math on how many markdown files of final reports of different stuff we can store on a system before it's not economically viable to keep them around anymore. Um, and like what we do with those, like I, it would be a shame to like delete, you know, last month's work, but maybe, um, stuff we've sent out that's been around for two years, um, we should be like doing garbage cleanup for, and like making sure that the stuff isn't always there. And so we'll need some sort of like method for like bringing these, the bits of data we're about to send to a temporary file location, a folder where we assemble the stuff that we're about to send out. And that might need to sit around long, at least long enough to work on the data, clean it up, massage it, you know, add some HTML markup, which you've just discovered. And I think there's a markup language for emails. Did you, I don't know if you ran into that or not. So that's another part of it is like, okay, the different ways we might want to format the email. So let's just focus on email for now. And we'll assume that putting it on a blog would be just It's the same thing, but an API call to the blog instead of an API call to the email service. And the notification thing might be like a little, is an API call to something that like actually has access to the mobile device. That's a nice to have, let's just say for now. So in terms of the email, we want something that kind of takes your content. 

The thing about the email is we want to... We're going to have to figure out the formatting stuff. And just so you know, I had a buddy who in 2026, I think, was hired into this secret team he couldn't tell me about in San Francisco. And he went off and did this thing. It turned out what he was doing was building the email publishing system for Nest. Have you heard of that? The like the thermal like changes your temperature in your home like device that Google now sells. And now he's a self-made millionaire living in New Zealand and doesn't work a day in his life. And all he did for them was build this email publishing tool. So like we're tackling something that's like, you know, very valuable to these teams. And also, you can go in pretty deep with the complexities of an email publishing system. And I'm assuming we won't need to do that for this. But who knows what kept him busy. He was really smart. So whatever he was doing must have been a lot, but kept him busy all day long. So we'll probably need to do some research on what these email publishing tools have in terms of the full suite of things. is there's probably ways to, like with a front end, like admin dashboard type thing, look at the emails that have come in, the emails that are sent, you know, track the users separate from the content that's going out and match them. So you can actually look for things that might come up as problems and alter the behavior of the whole system with a dashboard. So I'm guessing we could do a round of research on what that is. Like what's the minimum requirements? And what are these like large systems doing for sending like millions of emails? Right. And what's in scope? What's not? So that's something we should think about. But we're at this point where we've got the data from the AI that's produced something like this, like large chunks of text. And we'll be requesting that data to be saved in a temporary file or location where we just basically copy them over. So now we've got this folder with the things we want to publish. And it'll be time to assemble the email. And we talked about a templating system, I guess last time we talked, where we would have, we only need one template, but maybe two. I've found if you do something where you have at least two of something that's supposed to be interchangeable, you can check to make sure it really works for more than the one thing. So if we have two templates, one might be like raw text and the other one might be fancy with like a customized color scheme and some images that need to go with it and links to at the bottom to the socials or something. right? And so we have these two versions of it and we'll be applying a template to it. So what the template needs to have is pretty basic. It'll probably have maybe five or six placeholders in it in total, like how you address the user using shortcodes, which is a way of saying insert the user's first name or insert their last name or something like that. So you can kind of choose the formatting in the template instead of it being hard-coded somewhere. And so you just want anything that's like custom code or custom text to not be hard coded, right? That's a basic requirement of a templating system. And then we'll have probably some restrictions on how much of the text gets shown in the email. So if you've got an article that's hundreds of pages long, you just want the first paragraph or the first, I don't know what's reasonable, 200 words or something. And then so if something's larger than 200 words, we'll have a click here for more button, which will take you to the full view of it on the server. So you'll be able to jump to that and actually read the deep dive version of the text. And the template will then probably be main section, which will be just all of the things that are being returned. And then we probably need a secondary template which will be what each each report would be well probably I'm not really sure what our terminology should be if we should call this block of text that's being sent a report or yeah anyway so I'll just call it a report for now so we'll have like the report styling. So that'll be each report has a header and it's this size and the subheader is this size and then it has a who wrote it, what it's about, summary, and maybe the body of the text and the tags listed at the bottom. And that would be the template for a report and a report goes inside the main body. So we'd have maybe a maximum and I think we'll probably set the maximum number of reports in an email, either at the template level or in the dashboard for managing the email system. But that's kind of like about as much tuning you need. And then at the bottom to be compliant with law, we should have the unsubscribe button, the link there, which means anyone who's had enough can click a button to unsubscribe. And we need to tie that into that system where the user made these requests at the beginning, right? They entered something in the system that said, I want these every week. And now the user has clicked the unsubscribe button. That'll take them to a page that says that'll give them a summary of like, this is what you asked for. Remember, are you sure you want this to be canceled? And then if they hit cancel, it'll shows something on the screen there saying that it's now not going to send any more messages. The system, the dashboard sends an API call to the backend saying, this has been canceled or unsubscribed. And at that point, when we're asking for what to do, when that first major call that happens, like let's say daily that says do publishing, it will make sure that it's not getting records that have been unsubscribed, right? So that'll handle the unsubscribe logic. I think that'll be enough for that. And that'll be most of it. And then we've finally got this composed email. We've taken the templates. We've saved a version of that template. I think this is the way to do it because you don't want to do this all in memory because that means that the server has to have a larger amount of RAM in it. But then we'll assemble the template, like copy of the template and then we'll copy these chunks of content in after we've formatted them and we'll have this version of what we're about to send locally in a temporary file. So does that much make sense so far? 

So now we've got this temporary file and it represents the email we're going to send out. It's also going to represent the page that the user is going to see if they click the show me more button. It's going to take them to this custom page that's for them on the content that they were interested in. And in the future, that page could be have some really cool stuff in it. Like, you know, save this snippet for me for later or like let's dive into these topics further. The thing that Dante is working on on the front end has this like super slick interface for like these are the things I'm interested in and like suggest related topics. So we could have built into the webpage version, like a section where it's like, are you interested in this? Here's some other things you might be interested in. Do you wanna add them to the next email? Like, so you can actually curate and this turns out to be really important in this sort of thing. These systems don't know anything. So the only information they get is what they get from the user. So the more we get from the user about their interests the curating of the work, we're understanding the user. We're also understanding the space in general, right? Like if we have this massive knowledge base on everything about the creator ecosystem, we'll start to like create this mapping of, you know, what kind of people like, what kinds of things, what are they interested in? Like what, you know, which gives us this kind of crucial um uh weighting system where we can apply weights uh a number to how interesting things are to certain people so when the ai in the background is figuring out what to what it should do research on the things with higher weights will get a little more attention so it's like this kind of feedback loop we do need to like consider that in all parts of it and especially in the thing where we're showing them the results, they really need to have a way to say, this is cool, this isn't. So our, and to make this really work, our, the thing, the page that they go to, instead of it just being a rendered HTML page, static page, we may want to do something where that page is actually rendered when they open it. So like it does kind of the same logic that we're doing to assemble the email, but it does it on the fly when they ask for the page, because there's no point in saving these pages fully rendered as well as the, you know, chunks. We're already saving the like parts. We don't also want to like have to save a copy that's the full version of it, like, because it doubles the amount of space required, right? It also makes it harder to customize. It means like if they want to change the template, now we've got these old versions that are the old template, like, you know, it like, so we really want that to be a dynamic process anyway. So I think that whole thing where we're rendering that final version that we send off will be the same logic as the page they can see with some like variables for like, this is a page, This is an email. This is a publication to, you know, a blog. And this is a publication to somebody's phone. So we'll have like little flags in that piece of logic that's handling the how do we render this? So the render method, for lack of a better term, will probably be this sort of central set of code that handles that. And that'll probably be where all the tuning comes in. That'll be where we're saying it's not right, it's wrong font sizes. That's where us as humans will have to look at it and make a lot of tweaks and changes to make it look good and look professional. That's where the rubber hits the road, as they say. So now we have this whole pipeline. We've got from the ingestion to the file. We've got a way to render it if they click. And then there's this final moment where we do the publish calls. And so the publish call will be looking at the order for the thing that we're trying to publish. And it'll say, OK, this is an email and it's going to just this one person who asked for it. Or we'll have to work this out. I didn't discuss this with Dante. It's just occurring to me now. But it might be cool if you could like create your own list of people that receive it with you. I don't know like how that would work in real life. If you go to a system and you are getting custom emails, does it make sense to get like a group of people that follow you or are interested in you? I don't know if there's a connection there at all, or if this is really a personal system for yourself, you know? We'll have to think about that. It might be more obvious after what usually happens with something like this is you launch it and somebody goes, oh, you know, it'd be cool as if I could invite my friends to this or something. But so we would, we'd have a list of who we email it to for this, maybe this MVP, this first version, it just emails it to the person who created it. Yeah. And then I guess maybe what we could do is the, oh, this would be cool. So that set of pages where that one person is able to view what they're publishing, they could share that page with other people. And because it's a publicly visible page, in fact, the whole internet and all of the search engines will be hitting it too, which turns the entire system into this very large hub of information, which search engines love. It gives you higher scores when it comes to results. And if you could share that with people and then they could come and see it too, then maybe we can just have a subscribe button. So when you subscribe to that email, publish. Yeah. So what you would have is the email you're looking at. And then there'd be like maybe a sidebar or a link to the home of that set of emails. And that would be like all the emails that came out and a way to subscribe to it if you were interested. maybe we could even show um who's who else is subscribed you know it turns into this sort of social feedback loop which is like um very effective and uh that could be like a really good way to add people to that to the order for the public the publishing tool um for additional emails 

So at this point the publishing tool reads in the, sends the final work order to the final step in the pipeline, which is the dispatcher and it will dispatch the part it will do the actual taking of the template file that was created, the rendered work that's sitting and waiting to be sent. And it will call the API endpoint for sending emails and send the email and wait for the response from the API and save that to a log. And that is, needs to be a database of what the dispatcher did. That dispatch log will also have the details of the whole pipeline from the moment it was requested, the moment it entered the system to become something that needed to be done, the moment it was processed, what logic was used for processing, what templates were used, And when it was sent to the location to be emailed out, in this case, SES by Amazon, the simple email service. And then that log, each log entry is specific to that one request to that one API. So if a message is actually requested for, if one request coming in is actually supposed to go out to email and a blog service and a push notification and a text message. each one of those would be its own entry in the log database. And for each one of those, there's still a possibility after the call has happened for some sort of issue on the backend or some sort of response from the system. So when you send a message via text, at the end of it, it should say, do you wish to receive these messages anymore? And if the user says no, then that needs to be entered either in the, probably in the log for that message, but then propagated up to the system that's tracking the request for that user in the system. And so that it's similar to unsubscribe. The same thing happens with an email. The email one's also got a lot of complexities. It has the potential be bounced back. So that needs to be added to the log too for that request. So if an email is rejected by some part of the system, that will end up in the log. And I would think that the push to a blog system, you would get the response back during the API call. So it's less of a lag, but some of these things may have a lag in it. So in the table, there's a column for when issues happen, the error message.
