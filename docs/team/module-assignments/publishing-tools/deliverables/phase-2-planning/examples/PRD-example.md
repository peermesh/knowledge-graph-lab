### Data Constraints
- Data retention: Engagement data kept for 12 months
- Subscriber data: Must comply with GDPR/CCPA requirements
- Template size: Maximum 1MB per template
- Distribution queue: Maximum 10,000 pending items

## 5. Integration Points

### Inputs (What this module receives)
- From AI Module: Processed knowledge graph insights and summaries
- From Backend: User authentication and authorization tokens
- From Frontend: Distribution scheduling and configuration settings

### Outputs (What this module provides)
- To External: Formatted emails to subscriber addresses
- To External: JSON payloads to webhook endpoints
- To Backend: Engagement metrics and distribution status
- To Frontend: Real-time distribution progress updates

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Email Newsletter Distribution
**Given** a creator has 1000 subscribers and new knowledge insights
**When** they schedule a newsletter for 9 AM tomorrow
**Then** all active subscribers receive the formatted email at the scheduled time

### Scenario 2: Webhook Delivery
**Given** an API consumer has registered a webhook endpoint
**When** new insights matching their criteria are available
**Then** the system sends a properly formatted JSON payload to their endpoint

### Scenario 3: Failed Delivery Handling
**Given** an email delivery fails due to a temporary error
**When** the system detects the failure
**Then** it retries delivery up to 3 times with exponential backoff

### Scenario 4: Subscriber Preferences
**Given** a subscriber has set preferences for weekly digests only
**When** daily content is available
**Then** the system aggregates content and sends only on their preferred schedule

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Email sending: Process 1000 emails per minute
- Webhook delivery: < 500ms response time
- Template rendering: < 100ms per template

### Security
- Authentication: API key required for all operations
- Data encryption: TLS for all external communications
- Email validation: Verify addresses before sending

### Scalability
- Support up to 100,000 subscribers per creator
- Handle 1 million daily distributions across all users
- Queue system to handle traffic spikes

### Reliability
- 99.9% uptime for distribution services
- Delivery success rate > 95% for valid addresses
- Automatic failover for critical components

## 8. Constraints & Assumptions
