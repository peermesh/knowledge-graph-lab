## Research Philosophy: Depth-First Distillation

Your research should explore the full spectrum of frontend development - from basic React components to how Linear achieves sub-50ms interactions, how Figma handles real-time collaboration with 100+ concurrent users, and how Obsidian renders graphs with 10,000+ nodes. Understanding enterprise-scale implementations will inform your architectural decisions, even if your initial implementation is simpler.

**Research Approach:**
Document the full spectrum of solutions - from basic implementations to enterprise-scale systems. Understanding how companies like Linear, Figma, and Obsidian handle these challenges will inform your architectural decisions, even if your initial implementation is simpler.

## Research Deliverables

### By Thursday, September 12
1. **Technology Evaluation Matrix**: Compare all researched tools/libraries
2. **Architecture Proposal**: Your recommended tech stack with justification
3. **Performance Analysis**: Benchmarks of critical libraries
4. **Risk Assessment**: Technical challenges and mitigation strategies
5. **Learning Plan**: What you need to learn to implement your proposal

### Include in Your Research
- **Proof of Concepts**: Small demos testing critical assumptions
- **Industry Analysis**: How do Linear, Figma, Obsidian solve similar problems?
- **Performance Metrics**: Specific numbers from your testing
- **Accessibility Audit**: WCAG compliance strategy
- **Scaling Strategy**: How the architecture grows from MVP to enterprise

---

**Remember**: You're designing the face of our platform. Study how Linear achieves their legendary performance, how Figma enables magical collaboration, and how Obsidian makes complex knowledge feel tangible. Make it beautiful, fast, and accessible. The interface should make complex AI systems feel approachable and powerful research feel effortless.

**Don't Limit Yourself**: If you discover that the best solution involves WebGPU, quantum computing concepts, or distributed systems, document it. Even if we can't implement it during this project, understanding the ceiling helps us build a better floor.
