# Frontend Design: Phase 1 Research

Optional Deep Dive: see [02c-phase-1-research-advanced.md](02c-phase-1-research-advanced.md)

## Research Dependencies
**Required Before Starting**: System architecture requirements, user journey analysis

### Phase Milestones
- **Phase 1**: Technology comparison and initial recommendations
- **Phase 2**: Proof of concept and final recommendations

## Research Objectives

Research and recommend optimal technology choices for:

1. **UI Framework**: React vs Vue vs Angular vs Svelte
2. **State Management**: Redux vs MobX vs Context API vs Zustand
3. **Component Library**: Material-UI vs Ant Design vs custom solution
4. **Graph Visualization**: D3.js vs Cytoscape vs vis.js for 10K+ nodes
5. **Build Tooling**: Webpack vs Vite vs Parcel

## Success Criteria

Research is complete when you deliver:

- Clear technology recommendation for each category
- Proof of concept demonstrating 10K node graph rendering
- Performance benchmarks meeting system requirements
- Implementation roadmap with risk assessment

## Specific Research Tasks

### Core Technology Evaluation
- [ ] Compare React, Vue, Angular for knowledge graph applications (performance, community, learning curve)
- [ ] Evaluate graph visualization libraries with 10,000+ nodes (D3.js, Cytoscape, vis.js)
- [ ] Test state management with complex nested graph data (Redux, MobX, Context API, Zustand)
- [ ] Research component libraries for rapid development (Material-UI vs Ant Design vs custom)
- [ ] Compare CSS-in-JS vs traditional CSS for large applications (performance impact)

### System Integration Research
- [ ] Investigate Progressive Web App capabilities (service workers, offline support)
- [ ] Research accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA for complex visualizations)
- [ ] Evaluate testing frameworks (Jest for unit, Cypress/Playwright for e2e)
- [ ] Assess mobile responsiveness requirements (tablet-first design strategy)
- [ ] Research offline functionality implementation (graph caching, local storage limits)

## Key Research Tasks

- Benchmark 10,000+ node rendering to achieve 60fps performance
- Evaluate state management approaches for real-time graph updates
- Validate accessibility compliance for complex visualizations
- Design mobile strategy balancing functionality with performance
- Implement offline graph viewing and basic editing capabilities

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Performance**: Bundle size, rendering speed, memory usage
- **Developer Experience**: Learning curve, debugging tools, documentation quality
- **Ecosystem**: Available libraries, community size, maintenance status
- **Integration**: Compatibility with backend APIs, authentication, real-time updates

## Deliverables

### 1. Executive Summary
- Top recommendation for each technology choice
- Critical trade-offs and risk factors
- Implementation roadmap

### 2. Technology Analysis
- Pros/cons matrix with scoring (1-5 scale across performance, DX, ecosystem, integration)
- Performance benchmarks with specific metrics (load time, bundle size, memory usage)
- Code examples showing integration patterns with backend APIs

### 3. Proof of Concept
- Interactive demo with 10K node graph (pan, zoom, search functionality)
- Performance metrics: load time, frame rate, memory usage under stress
- Setup instructions and deployment notes for team evaluation

### 4. Implementation Roadmap
- Phase-based development plan with clear milestones
- Risk mitigation strategies for each technology choice
- Resource requirements and team skill assessment

## Performance Benchmarks

### Graph Rendering Requirements
- Load time: <3 seconds for 1,000 nodes
- Frame rate: Maintain 60fps during pan/zoom operations
- Memory usage: <500MB for 10,000 nodes
- Search performance: <200ms for node/edge queries

### UI Framework Requirements
- Initial bundle size: <1MB gzipped
- Time to interactive: <2 seconds
- Re-render performance: <16ms for component updates
- Build time: <30 seconds for development builds

## Research Methodology

1. **Literature Review**: Official documentation and community resources
2. **Hands-on Testing**: Build small prototypes for each option
3. **Performance Testing**: Use standardized benchmark scenarios
4. **Community Assessment**: GitHub activity, issue response time, ecosystem

## System Context

### Architecture Dependencies
- Must integrate with Neo4j graph database
- Backend API uses FastAPI with async endpoints
- Real-time updates via WebSocket connections
- Authentication through JWT tokens

### User Experience Requirements
- Support for 6 user personas (researchers, creators, analysts)
- Mobile-responsive design for tablet usage
- Keyboard navigation for accessibility
- Internationalization support (English, Spanish initially)
