# Archived Files - Format Evolution

**Date archived:** 2025-10-09

**Reason:** Multiple format iterations replaced by dual-output methodology

## What's here

### Original Problematic Files (archived earlier)

**actionable-task-list.md (987 lines)**

- **Created:** Earlier iteration
- **Problem:** Invented content (Node.js v18+, specific tech not in conversation)
- **Problem:** Mixed implementation with requirements
- **What worked:** Visual structure, automation hints, dependency tracking

**detailed-requirements-from-vision.md (640 lines)**

- **Created:** Earlier iteration  
- **Problem:** Jumped into deep complexity not in conversation
- **Problem:** Invented specifications instead of extracting
- **What worked:** Attempted to capture essence

### Single-Document Prose Format

**2025-10-09-distilled-dante-conversation.md (626 lines)**

- **Created:** 2025-10-08 20:05
- **Format:** Single-document prose extraction (improved from original)
- **Problems:**
  - Dense prose (hard to scan)
  - Decisions buried in paragraphs
  - Not optimized for different audiences
- **What worked:**
  - Extraction discipline maintained
  - Zero invention
  - Quote preservation

**Replaced by:** Dual-output format (2 files)

- `2025-10-09-frontend-decisions-agreements.md` (279 lines - scannable)
- `2025-10-09-frontend-implementation-guide.md` (697 lines - actionable)

## Format Evolution Timeline

1. **First attempt:** actionable-task-list.md, detailed-requirements-from-vision.md
   - Good: Actionable format, visual structure
   - Bad: Invented content, mixed concerns

2. **Second attempt:** distilled-dante-conversation.md (single-document prose)
   - Good: Extraction discipline, no invention
   - Bad: Dense, not scannable, single audience

3. **Current:** Dual-output (decisions-agreements + implementation-guide)
   - Maintains extraction discipline
   - Scannable tables/cards
   - Actionable tasks with provenance
   - Serves all audiences without compromise

## Why Preserved

Historical record of methodology evolution:

- Learning from invention issues → extraction discipline
- Learning from usability issues → dual-output format
- Anti-patterns documented for future reference
