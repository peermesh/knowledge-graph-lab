## 1. MVP Features Agreement

### Explicitly Agreed for MVP

**User Authentication:** Email signup/login for saving preferences
> "The user needs to be able to sign up for emails and they need to be able to, you know, obviously log in so that they can make custom settings for their deep research results"

**Topic Selection Interface:** Choose or type interests (not AI conversation for MVP)
> "What we're going to do is choose or type in what you want the research to be about"
- Out of scope for MVP: AI prompt interface ("probably out of scope because that means another AI agent is on the front end having a conversation with you")

**Publishing Channel Configuration:** UI for selecting output channels and intervals
> "We've got the email... We'll figure out what those are. So push to your own blog. Right. And then we also want to be able to, um, turn this off, turn them on. And for each one of those choose the interval"

**Lab Views - Graph Visualization:** Ontology mapping with nodes and relationships
> "We've got that one that you found the nodes and points. That'll be great for the the one of the main things that the AI is good at, which is this uh, uh, ontology mapping where you're mapping the, um, two objects together and the line between them"

**Hierarchical Topic Browser:** Yahoo-directory style drill-down interface
> "Back in the day, Yahoo was a big deal... you could click on the text or you could click on the subtext, and then it would take you to another page or another view that was like that thing that you just clicked on broken down even further"

**Bubble Onboarding:** Interactive bubble interface for initial preference gathering
> "I think the good ones actually get a little more information from the user by having two states. So you can like click once and it's like a green circle around the bubble. And that means you like it. And you can click on one twice and it gets a little smaller and a red circle appears around it. And that means you definitely don't want any of that"

**Three-Column Layout:** Standard IDE-style layout
> "Maybe the left-hand side would be like the things that you have refined... And then on the right-hand side, what we'll do is that'll be our filter for like whatever you've selected, you can fine-tune the results... And then that'll be our basic map of the space that we'll stick to"

**Feed View:** Content feed in center panel
> "What you really want in the middle is a feed of the content"

### Discussed but Deferred to Post-MVP

**Multiple Lab Views:** Additional ways to explore ontology data beyond graph
> "We have an opportunity to think about how else can we explore hierarchical ontologies or relationships to content. And that will be, you know, I think we can like leave that as a stretch goal"

**Social Features:** Sharing, collaboration, multi-user subscriptions
> Not explicitly confirmed for MVP

**Advanced Feed Features:** Save snippets, deep dive into topics from feed
> Future enhancement mentioned

### Scope Notes

**Lab Views Priority:**
- One lab view (graph visualization) is MVP
- Additional views are stretch goals
- Framework should support adding more views later

**Onboarding:**
- Bubble interface is MVP
- Can be returned to later, not just first-time
- Provides exploratory way to build interest profile

## 2. Technical Implementation Decisions

### Decision: React with Vite

**What was decided:** Use React framework with Vite build tool

**Rationale:** Modern frontend tooling, fast build times

**Quote:**
> "We're going to be using React... with Vite"

**Implementation notes:** Standard React development environment

### Decision: Cursor IDE for Development

**What was decided:** Use Cursor IDE as development environment

**Quote:**
> "We're using cursor"

**Implementation notes:** IDE with AI-assisted coding features

**Open Question:** Specific Node.js version not discussed (v18+ mentioned in problematic AI-generated file was invented)

### Decision: Cytoscape.js for Graph Visualization

**What was decided:** Use Cytoscape.js library for ontology graph rendering

**Rationale:** Good balance of performance and features for 10K+ nodes

**Quote:**
> "Cytoscape.js is good balance of performance plus features"

**Context:** Need to handle large knowledge graphs with nodes, edges, and relationship labels

**Implementation notes:** Display ontology relationships where edge labels show relationship type (e.g., "bees" → "gets nectar from" → "flowers")

### Decision: Dynamic Data-Driven UI

**What was decided:** UI renders whatever JSON data AI provides, no hardcoded structure

**Rationale:** Flexibility to display varying hierarchical data

**Quote:**
> "It's all going to be coming in in a JSON file. And what we really want is an interface that is dynamic. So whatever the JSON file gives us, we display"

**Implementation notes:** UI must adapt to JSON structure for hierarchical content

### Decision: Three-Column Layout Pattern

**What was decided:** Standard IDE-style layout with left sidebar, main content, right sidebar

**Layout:**
- **Left column:** Menu/navigation, user's refined choices, lab view selection
- **Center column:** Main content (feed, bubble onboarding, or active lab view)
- **Right column:** Filters and settings for selected content

**Quote:**
> "The idea would be to have like a column on the left... And then on the right-hand side, what we'll do is that'll be our filter for like whatever you've selected, you can fine-tune the results"

**Reference:**
> "Like this IDE is a very standard affair, right? You break up this square space into areas"

**Open Question:** Responsive design for mobile not discussed

### Decision: Feed Component with Infinite Scroll

**What was decided:** Use off-the-shelf React infinite scroll component

**Rationale:** Standard pattern, handles memory management, proven UX

**Quote:**
> "We'll find a off the shelf probably a react based component that does that whole feed thing for us"

**Feed Mechanics:**
- Paginated API calls (request 10 items at a time)
- Load next batch as user nears end
- Recycle views to prevent memory overload
- Pull-down to reload
- Swipe gestures (TikTok-style UX)

**Quote:**
> "There'll be some numbers, like, you know, ask for 10 pieces of content at a time. And then like it'll load and then we get near the end of it. It'll ask for the next 10"

**Memory Management:**
> "If you don't recycle views, you just end up with a lot of memory overload problems where everything you've loaded is still in memory. So that's part of the magic of a good infinite scroll component is it handles the memory right"

### Decision: Competitive Analysis Before Design

**What was decided:** Research 10+ similar products before finalizing UI design

**Rationale:** Learn from existing solutions, identify gaps, avoid known pain points

**Quote:**
> "We want to do, and maybe I mentioned this, is we know what we want to build kind of right. And now I've got this transcript of what it is. We'll distill that into like a very, like lots of information. It's going to be very useful. And what we're going to do is try to find projects and products and platforms that are on the market that do exactly this"

**Process:**
- Find 10+ competitors
- Screenshot interfaces
- Review app store ratings for pain points
- Identify best practices
- Note gaps and opportunities

**Quote:**
> "You go to the ratings of the, on the app store where everyone's bitching about the app that your, that your competitor has made. And that's like your, that's, that's the that's the gold right there"

### Decision: Design Lookbook with AI-Assisted Generation

**What was decided:** Create visual lookbook, use AI tools (V0, Lovable, Cursor) with image inputs for design generation

**Process:**
1. Collect design inspiration (competitors, Webby Awards, design trends)
2. Build lookbook in Figma
3. Use AI tools with visual inputs to generate UI variations
4. Iterate quickly through multiple designs

**Quote:**
> "You can drop in images along with your description of the interface and it will use the images, like the color schemes, the shapes as influence for the design"

**Tools mentioned:**
- V0
- Lovable
- Cursor
- Figma (for lookbook)

**Quote:**
> "Give it like crazy input, visual input, like your lookbook best bits, which is why you do the lookbook so that when you get to that point where you're like, okay, let's hit the button. Let's see what it can do"

**Design Research:**
> "I like to do is do a search for top design trends of the year that you're in"

**Open Question:** Specific color scheme, typography not decided (awaiting competitive analysis)

## 3. Integration Contracts

### Backend Integration

**Purpose:** Frontend requests user data, content, and manages state

**Direction:** Bi-directional (Frontend ↔ Backend)

**What Frontend Needs from Backend:**
- User authentication/session management
- User preference data (topics, publishing settings)
- Content feed API (paginated)
- Publishing configuration storage

**Feed API (Inferred Structure):**
- Request: `{ offset: number, limit: 10 }`
- Response: `{ items: [...], has_more: boolean, next_offset: number }`

**Quote (Feed Mechanics):**
> "The part that we'll need to figure out is what content do we want in the feed? And like how many, how many, like there'll be some numbers, like, you know, ask for 10 pieces of content at a time"

**Publishing Preference Storage:**
> "We've got the email... push to your own blog. Right. And then we also want to be able to, um, turn this off, turn them on. And for each one of those choose the interval"

**Open Question:** Exact API endpoints, authentication mechanism, data schemas not specified

### AI Module Integration

**Purpose:** Frontend requests AI-generated content and related topics

**Direction:** Frontend → AI (request/response)

**Related Topics API:**
- User types/selects seed topic
- Frontend requests ~4-5 related topics from AI
- AI returns related concepts
- Frontend displays as orbiting bubbles (in onboarding) or suggestions (in explorer)

**Quote:**
> "The AI, we send a message to the backend saying, get me some research results or no, better. It won't be research results at this point. It'll be get me related ideas to the thing that we're sending back. And I'll, I want about four or five of them"

**Ontology Graph Data:**
- JSON format with hierarchical structure
- Contains: nodes (topics/concepts), edges (relationships), labels (relationship types)
- Supports drill-down navigation

**Quote:**
> "So it's all going to be coming in in a JSON file. And what we really want is an interface that is dynamic. So whatever the JSON file gives us, we display. and so I'm going to imagine that's probably some sort of hierarchy of content"

**Ontology Example Structure (from conversation):**
- Top level: "creator economy", "open source"
- Second level: "venues and musicians" (under creator economy), "GitHub, recent open source" (under open source)
- Each level clickable for further drill-down

**User Feedback to AI:**
- User selections (checked topics) sent back to Backend/AI
- Creates weights for AI research priorities
- Feedback loop: more users interested = higher research priority

**Quote:**
> "You'll have to somehow be able to take that list of topics and assign it to the things that we're going to receive messages about. So back on that other screen where you can choose the email or the blog posts or the messages, text messages, you'll now have a menu of the things that you chose"

**Weighting System:**
> "We'll be able to send those choices back to the server and the AI on the backend that's trying to figure out what everyone's interested in can use those to like create weights for like, oh, there's 20 people that like music. So I guess I'll do a little more research on music"

**Open Question:** Exact JSON schemas for related topics API and ontology graph not specified

## 4. User Workflows

### Workflow: Onboarding (Bubble Interface)

**Steps:**
1. User arrives at blank page
2. Single circle in middle with "+" sign
3. User clicks "+", prompted to enter first interest
4. User types topic (e.g., "creator ecosystem")
5. Frontend sends request to AI: "get related topics, return ~5"
6. AI returns 5 related topics
7. Frontend displays as smaller bubbles orbiting the main topic
8. User can:
   - Click once on bubble: green circle, topic added to interests (liked)
   - Double-click on bubble: red circle, topic excluded (disliked)
   - Double-click for more: requests additional related topics from AI
9. Process repeats, building user's interest map
10. User can return to bubble interface anytime, not just onboarding

**Quote:**
> "We'll start with a, like a screen with a one circle in the middle and a plus sign. And there won't be much else to do other than click the plus sign. And when you do that, you get a, you get asked, you know, what do you want in this plus sign?"

**Interaction States:**
> "I think the good ones actually get a little more information from the user by having two states. So you can like click once and it's like a green circle around the bubble. And that means you like it. And you can click on one twice and it gets a little smaller and a red circle appears around it"

**Design Philosophy:**
> "We don't want to overly influence you. What we really want to do is become a very useful tool that it's pretty, it's fun, it's not cluttered with lots of text"

**Optional Return:**
> "After you've like, after we've like brought you into this thing and you're a daily user, the bubbles might be just tiring. Right. But what you really want in the middle is a feed of the content"

### Workflow: Hierarchical Topic Exploration

**Steps:**
1. User selects hierarchical browser view (from left sidebar lab section)
2. Frontend requests ontology data from AI (JSON)
3. Frontend displays top-level topics (e.g., "creator economy", "open source")
4. Each topic shows 2-3 subtopics beneath it
5. User clicks on topic or subtopic
6. View updates to show that topic broken down further
7. At any level, user can check box next to item to add to interests
8. Selected topics added to "topics you're interested in" list
9. This list available for assignment to publishing channels

**Quote:**
> "And you'll be able to click in and kind of dive into that. And I think what we want to do is figure out a kind of balance where the amount of stuff on the screen isn't too little and isn't too much. At any level, there's like a little tick box next to the item. And if you click on it, it becomes part of your list of interesting topics"

**Navigation Pattern:**
> "You could click on the text or you could click on the subtext, and then it would take you to another page or another view that was like that thing that you just clicked on broken down even further"

**Example Hierarchy:**
> "You'll get this like, say we're asking for the creator economy and we're asking for open source. There'll be at the top level open sourcing the creator economy to levels of text under that, Like the most primary, most important ones will come out, you know, so maybe it'll be venues and musicians or something, right, for the creator economy"

### Workflow: Content Feed Consumption

**Steps:**
1. User navigates to feed view (center panel, default after onboarding)
2. Frontend requests initial content batch (10 items) from Backend
3. Feed displays content (format TBD, likely cards or list items)
4. User scrolls through content
5. As user nears end, Frontend requests next batch (offset-based pagination)
6. Seamless infinite scroll experience
7. User can interact with content:
   - Swipe actions (TikTok-style)
   - Side buttons for share, save, reactions
   - Pull down to reload
8. Feed recycles views for memory efficiency

**Quote:**
> "That center part for now, I think should be this like feed of reports... Back when it was invented, with a pain in the ass to program, nobody really knew what needed to happen there... At this point, we've got TikTok and nobody can put it down"

**UI Pattern:**
> "Swipe and then snap and hold um uh pull down to reload uh for the top um interface elements like on the edges for anything that you want to do with that thing like share it save it um put smiley faces on it"

**Pagination:**
> "There'll be some numbers, like, you know, ask for 10 pieces of content at a time. And then like it'll load and then we get near the end of it. It'll ask for the next 10"

### Workflow: Publishing Configuration

**Steps:**
1. User navigates to publishing settings (location TBD, likely left sidebar or dedicated section)
2. UI displays available channels:
   - Email (toggle on/off)
   - Blog platforms (toggle on/off)
   - Push notifications (toggle on/off)
   - Text messages (toggle on/off)
3. For each enabled channel, user selects interval (e.g., "weekly", "daily")
4. User assigns topics of interest to channels (dropdown or selector)
5. Topics come from previously selected interests (bubble/hierarchy interfaces)
6. Frontend saves configuration to Backend
7. User can modify anytime

**Quote:**
> "We've got the email... We'll figure out what those are. So push to your own blog. Right. And then we also want to be able to, um, turn this off, turn them on. And for each one of those choose the interval"

**Topic Assignment:**
> "You'll now have a menu of the things that you chose from that other screen where you could drill down and see what was there and actually pick what was interesting to you"

**Open Question:** Exact UI layout for publishing settings not specified

---

## 5. Technical Specifications

### Component Architecture

**Left Sidebar (Menu/Navigation):**
- Top section: Major content sections
- "Your" section: Liked topics, watched content, selected interests
- "Lab" section: Lab view selector (graph viz, future views)
- Clicking item in left sidebar changes main content area

**Quote:**
> "Maybe the left-hand side would be like the things that you have refined. So maybe like if you've been on YouTube, the left-hand column is like broken into subsections of this top part is like major subsections of their content... And then underneath that is the Your section, which has the things that you've liked"

**Center Panel (Main Content):**
- Default: Content feed
- Alternative: Bubble onboarding interface
- Alternative: Active lab view (graph, hierarchy browser, future views)
- Changes based on left sidebar selection

**Right Sidebar (Filters/Settings):**
- Contextual to main content selection
- Fine-tune results for selected item
- Similar to video editor property panels

**Quote:**
> "And then on the right-hand side, what we'll do is that'll be our filter for like whatever you've selected, you can fine-tune the results, which is very similar to like most software editing packages like video editors and things like that. Whatever you select, you have a way to dial in the values for it"

### State Management

**Client-Side State:**
- Current view (feed, bubbles, lab view)
- Selected topics/interests (temporary before save)
- Feed scroll position
- Filter settings

**Server-Side State:**
- User authentication
- Saved topic preferences
- Publishing channel configuration
- User profile data

**Synchronization:**
- Topic selections sent to Backend when user saves/confirms
- Publishing preferences persisted to Backend
- Feed data fetched from Backend API

**Open Question:** Specific state management library (Redux, Context API, etc.) not discussed

### Performance Requirements

**Graph Visualization:**
- Must handle 10K+ nodes
- Cytoscape.js chosen for performance balance

**Feed:**
- Must recycle views to prevent memory issues
- Paginated loading (10 items at a time)
- Smooth infinite scroll

**UI Responsiveness:**
- "Fast build" mentioned as reason for Vite
- No specific performance metrics discussed

**Open Question:** Load time targets, animation frame rates not specified

### UX Design Principles

**Avoid Overwhelming Users:**
> "We don't want to overly influence you. What we really want to do is become a very useful tool that it's pretty, it's fun, it's not cluttered with lots of text"

**Cognitive Load Management:**
> "The problem is the brain doesn't like parsing that stuff. It's like, it just, it sees it as a big blob. It doesn't see it as 20 interesting things. So that's what we're dealing with here is a brain that one of the core design principles is brains like to group things"

**Chunking and Summarization:**
> "They like to chunk things and they like to summarize, uh, instantaneously without you even being conscious of it, what you're looking at"

**Balance:**
> "Figure out a kind of balance where the amount of stuff on the screen isn't too little and isn't too much"

**Short Words in UI:**
> "Typically, you want your interface to be really short words"

## 7. Critical Quotes

**Vision for AI-Powered Development:**
> "We're doing an experiment here. We're seeing what we can do to leverage AI and become an AI development team. It looks great on the resume"

**Prototype-Driven Approach:**
> "So you know that thing that kept you from doing any of this stuff that you really wanted to do? Yeah, so that's why I've got 12 programs running, building 12 things at once"

**Zero-to-One Philosophy:**
> "What I've been doing since the last call is thinking about how to go from zero to one. That's a lovely catchphrase in Silicon Valley. It means you didn't have anything. Now you've got something to demo"

**SpecKit Integration:**
> "There's a new thing that I've tried, and I haven't tried it enough yet. It's called SpecKit... I watched the youtube video while i downloaded it and before he was done babbling and introducing the introduction of the introduction you know how they are on the youtube this is what i'm about to say and and then after that I'm going to say this other thing. Anyway, before he had actually gotten to the point and shown off the demo, I had run the demo on my machine on a couple of things. Totally seamless"

**User Understanding Philosophy:**
> "The more we get from the user about their interests the curating of the work, we're understanding the user. We're also understanding the space in general"

**Feed UX Reference:**
> "We've got TikTok and nobody can put it down. Clearly, swipe and then snap and hold"

**Design Research Importance:**

**Cognitive Load Principle:**
> "Brains like to group things. Um, and they like to chunk things and they like to summarize, uh, instantaneously without you even being conscious of it, what you're looking at"

**AI Tool Workflow:**
> "You can drop in images along with your description of the interface and it will use the images, like the color schemes, the shapes as influence for the design. So you can go and get like billboard ads or like things that like are like, you know, do not intersect web interfaces. Like, I don know, the backs of cereal boxes, right?"

**Development Philosophy:**
> "We're not vibe coding, which is you don't even look at the code. And we're not hand coding, which is it will take you five days to get one file working properly, maybe two or three. And what you needed was 50, right? So we're going to try to hit that middle ground"
