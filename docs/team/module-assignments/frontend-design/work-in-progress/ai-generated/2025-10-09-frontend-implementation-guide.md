## Implementation Readiness Matrix

**Purpose:** Quick scan of which phases can start vs. blocked

| Phase | Can Start? | Blockers | Dependencies | Confidence |
|-------|------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Phase 0: Research & Setup** | ‚úÖ Yes | None | None | **High** - Competitive analysis, design research, standard setup |
| **Phase 1: Core Layout** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | - Auth mechanism (OQ #3) | Phase 0 | **Medium** - Layout can be built, login blocked until auth defined |
| **Phase 2: Bubble Onboarding** | ‚ùå No | - Related topics API (OQ #4) | Phase 0, Phase 1 | **Low** - Core functionality blocked until API defined |
| **Phase 3: Feed Interface** | ‚ùå No | - Backend feed API (OQ #1)<br>- Pagination API (OQ #7) | Phase 0, Phase 1 | **Low** - Cannot fetch/display content without API |
| **Phase 4: Graph & Hierarchy** | ‚ùå No | - AI JSON format (OQ #2) | Phase 0, Phase 1 | **Low** - Cannot render dynamic data without schema |
| **Phase 5: Integration & Polish** | ‚ùå No | - All Phase 1-4 blockers | All prior phases | **Low** - Fully blocked until integrations defined |

**Key Takeaways:**
- ‚úÖ **Can start immediately:** Phase 0 (Research & Setup) - no blockers
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Requires planning:** Phase 1 (Core Layout) - can build layout, but login blocked
- ‚ùå **Fully blocked:** Phases 2, 3, 4, 5 - resolve Document 1 Open Questions first

**Recommended Sequence:**
1. Start Phase 0 immediately (competitive analysis, design research, project setup)
2. Build Phase 1 layout structure (skip login/signup until auth resolved)
3. Resolve all üî¥ blockers (Open Questions #1, #2, #3, #4, #7)
4. Begin Phases 2, 3, 4 (can work in parallel once unblocked)
5. Complete with Phase 5 integration

#### P3.1: Infinite Scroll Component

**Time Savings:** 2-3 hours
**Learning Trade-off:** Low (library integration)

**Could ask agent:**
"Integrate React infinite scroll library (react-infinite-scroll-component). Configure to fetch 10 items per page, implement view recycling for memory efficiency, add pull-to-refresh. Handle loading states and end-of-content."

#### P4.1: Cytoscape Graph Visualization

**Time Savings:** 2 hours
**Learning Trade-off:** Low (library integration)

**Could ask agent:**
"Integrate Cytoscape.js into React. Create graph visualization component that renders nodes (entities) and edges (relationships with labels). Enable pan/zoom. Style nodes as circles with text labels, edges as arrows with relationship text."

### Do NOT Automate (üë§ Human-design tasks)

- **P0.1: Competitive Analysis** - Requires strategic thinking, user empathy
- **P0.2: Design Trends Research** - Visual curation, aesthetic judgment
- **P0.4: Component Library Research** - Quality evaluation, project fit assessment
- **P1.2: Navigation Menu** - UX decisions, visual design
- **P2.1: Initial Bubble UI** - Visual design, animation feel, user delight
- **P3.2: Feed Item Component** - Content presentation, visual hierarchy
- **P4.2: Hierarchy Browser** - Information architecture, cognitive load management

## Unknowns & Decisions Needed

**From Document 1 Open Questions - Must Resolve Before Implementation:**

### üî¥ Blockers (Cannot Proceed)

| # | Question | Blocks Phase | Impact | Who Can Answer |
|---|----------|--------------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Backend API schema (feed, user data) | P3.3, P5.1 | Cannot fetch/display content | Backend developer |
| 2 | AI JSON format (ontology, hierarchy) | P4.3 | Cannot render dynamic data | AI module owner |
| 3 | Authentication mechanism (JWT, OAuth, etc.) | P1.4 | Cannot implement login | Security/backend |
| 4 | Related topics API contract | P2.2 | Cannot build bubble onboarding | Backend/AI |
| 7 | Pagination API (cursor, offset, page size) | P3.1, P3.3 | Cannot implement infinite scroll | Backend developer |

### üü° Important (Affects Design)

| # | Question | Affects Phase | Impact | Who Can Answer |
|---|----------|---------------|--------|----------------|
| 5 | Component library selection | P3.1, P4.1 | Implementation approach | Frontend/research (P0.4) |
| 6 | Design system (colors, typography) | All phases | Visual consistency | Design/product (P0.2) |
| 10 | Memory management strategy | P3.1 | Performance, UX | Frontend architect |
| 13 | State management library | P5.1 | Architecture pattern | Frontend architect (P0.4) |

### Phase 1: Core Layout
- **3-panel layouts** - IDE-style interfaces, CSS Grid mastery
- **React Router** - Multi-view navigation, route management
- **Authentication UI** - Login flows, protected routes

### Phase 2: Bubble Onboarding
- **Interactive animations** - Bubble physics, orbital motion
- **Progressive disclosure** - Gamified UX, user engagement
- **API integration** - Async data fetching, state updates

### Phase 3: Feed Interface
- **Infinite scroll** - Memory management, view recycling
- **TikTok-style UX** - Swipe interactions, snap behavior
- **Dynamic rendering** - JSON-driven UI, flexible layouts

### Phase 4: Graph & Hierarchy
- **Graph visualization** - Cytoscape.js, node/edge rendering
- **Information architecture** - Hierarchical data, drill-down UX
- **Dynamic JSON** - Variable structure handling

### Phase 5: Integration & Polish
- **State management** - Global state, cross-component communication
- **Accessibility** - WCAG compliance, keyboard navigation
