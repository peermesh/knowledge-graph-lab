## Troubleshooting Guide

### Stuck on a task?
1. **Break it smaller** - Can this task be split into 2-3 smaller tasks?
2. **Google it** - Search "[technology] [what you're trying to do]"
3. **Ask AI** - Paste the task into Claude/ChatGPT with "How do I do this?"
4. **Skip for now** - Mark it, move to next task, come back later

### Common issues:
- **npm install fails** ‚Üí Delete node_modules and package-lock.json, try again
- **Import errors** ‚Üí Check file path is correct (relative path)
- **TypeScript errors** ‚Üí Start with .tsx files, ignore types initially if stuck
- **Styling not working** ‚Üí Check Tailwind config, make sure CSS is imported
- **API calls fail** ‚Üí Check network tab in DevTools, verify endpoint URL
