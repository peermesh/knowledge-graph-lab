Got it — I’ll take this as the working brief. Below is a compact, actionable research plan that maps directly to your REQUIRED OUTPUTS (A–G), the SEARCH METHODOLOGY you specified, and the evaluation rubric. If this looks good I can begin harvesting primary sources and building the inventories/citations immediately (I’ll ask before I run large crawls).

## Plan & approach (high level)

**Goal:** Produce a rigorous, source-traceable landscape on architectures and tooling for large-scale enterprise design systems, with inventories, scored comparisons, licensing analysis and an evidence pack.

**Phases**

1.  **Scoping & seed queries** — generate an exhaustive list of search queries (vendor whitepapers, tech blogs, GitHub, academic DBs).
    
2.  **Source collection** — prioritize primary sources (vendor docs, company engineering blogs, GitHub repos, standards bodies, papers).
    
3.  **Data extraction** — capture structured metadata per library/system into a canonical CSV/JSONL (20+ fields).
    
4.  **Scoring & analysis** — apply Evaluation Rubric (0–5) per system and compute comparative matrices + licensing matrix.
    
5.  **Synthesis & deliverables** — produce A–G (CSV/JSONL, matrices, evidence pack, search log, academic snapshot).
    
6.  **Review pass** — flag unknowns, confidence levels, and any gaps where primary evidence is missing.
    

## Seed search queries (will run across Google, Google Scholar, GitHub, arXiv, company blogs)

-   "enterprise design system architecture survey"
    
-   "scalable component library patterns enterprise mono-repo micro-frontends"
    
-   "large org design system case study 'design system' 'architecture' 'mono-repo' 'micro frontends'"
    
-   "multi-brand theming enterprise design system case study"
    
-   "design tokens enterprise 'Style Dictionary' 'W3C design tokens' case study"
    
-   "component library governance licensing 'SPDX' 'contribution policy'"
    
-   "design system mono-repo vs micro-frontends pros cons"
    
-   "Case study 'Atlassian design system' architecture"
    
-   "Case study 'Salesforce Lightning' architecture 'multi-brand'"
    
-   "Case study 'Shopify Polaris' architecture"
    
-   "Case study 'IBM Carbon' architecture mono-repo"
    
-   "design system 'multi-brand' theming 'scaling' 'theming variables'"
    
-   "academic survey 'design systems' 'component libraries' 'scalability'"
    

(If you want, I’ll add target companies/orgs to this list — e.g., Atlassian, Salesforce, IBM, Shopify, Microsoft, Airbnb, Uber, GitHub — and specific repositories/orgs.)

## Canonical CSV / JSONL inventory — suggested fields (≥20)

1.  id (slug)
    
2.  name
    
3.  org / vendor
    
4.  repo URL
    
5.  primary language / framework (React / Web Components / Vue / Angular / platform-agnostic)
    
6.  architecture model (mono-repo / multi-repo / micro-frontends / modular packages / design tokens only)
    
7.  packaging / distribution (npm monorepo, scoped packages, CDN, internal registry)
    
8.  versioning strategy (semver / monorepo release tool e.g., Lerna/Bazel/Rush)
    
9.  component registry / cataloging (Storybook / internal portal / design language website)
    
10.  theming approach (tokens, CSS vars, CSS-in-JS, tokens manager)
    
11.  multi-brand support (yes/no + mechanism)
    
12.  accessibility stance (WCAG level, automated tests, ARIA conventions)
    
13.  CI/CD tooling (build, test, publish)
    
14.  testing strategy (unit, visual/regression, screenshot testing)
    
15.  docs & contribution process (docs site, CONTRIBUTING.md, templates)
    
16.  governance model (centralized / federated / platform team / community)
    
17.  license (SPDX)
    
18.  contributor policy & CLA (yes/no)
    
19.  adoption metrics (internal teams, public downloads, stars) — numeric where available
    
20.  release cadence (frequency)
    
21.  security / vulnerability handling (policy or process)
    
22.  integrations (Figma, Storybook, token tools)
    
23.  commercial support / paid offering (yes/no)
    
24.  maturity level (est. yrs active / stable / beta)
    
25.  references / primary sources (URLs)
    
26.  confidence (high/medium/low/unknown) — source-backed
    
27.  notes / open issues (free text)
    

I can expand/modify these fields to match any internal data model you already use.

## Evaluation rubric mapping (0–5) — how scores map to evidence

-   **Scalability (tech/process/culture)** — evidence: multi-repo/mono-repo strategy, CI scale, adoption metrics, governance.
    
    -   0 = No evidence of scale; 5 = proven at large org scale (multiple brands, many teams), explicit architecture patterns + telemetry.
        
-   **Modularity & maintainability** — evidence: package-level separation, dependency graph, incremental build tooling.
    
-   **Multi-brand/theming support** — evidence: tokens, theming demos, brand switches, real-world case studies.
    
-   **Documentation & process rigor** — evidence: contributor guides, RFC processes, on-boarding, docs coverage.
    
-   **Governance & licensing fit** — evidence: publicly posted governance, SPDX license, CLA, code ownership.
    

(Each scored 0–5 with a one-line justification and confidence tag. I’ll compute an aggregate score if you want.)

## Licensing matrix approach

-   Capture SPDX identifier per component/tool.
    
-   For each SPDX ID record:
    
    -   permissions (e.g., commercial use, modification)
        
    -   obligations (copyleft requirements, attribution)
        
    -   restrictions (patent clauses, network-use)
        
    -   mitigation notes (how an enterprise can legally consume or relicense)
        
-   Flag any mixed-license risk inside monorepos or bundled assets.
    
-   Provide remediation options (license compatibility, shims, internal fork strategies, contributor agreement recommendations).
    

## Deliverables — formats & what you’ll get

A) **INVENTORY**: CSV and JSONL with the fields above (download link).  
B) **COMPARATIVE MATRIX**: Top 10–20 systems scored and visually tabulated (CSV + Markdown matrix).  
C) **LICENSING MATRIX**: SPDX table, risk flags, recommended mitigations (CSV + short report).  
D) **LANDSCAPE SUMMARY**: 800–1,200 word narrative clustering leaders / gaps / emerging players.  
E) **ACADEMIC SNAPSHOT**: 5–15 papers (citation + one-line takeaway each).  
F) **EVIDENCE PACK**: For the 10 most load-bearing claims, include citation + ≤40-word quote excerpt (sourced).  
G) **SEARCH LOG**: Full query log, rationale per query, and dead-end notes (text file).

I will tag each fact with: **confidence: high / medium / low / unknown** and show the primary source(s).

## Citation policy & primary-source priority

-   Prioritize vendor docs, engineering blog posts, standards bodies (W3C/Tokens), GitHub repos, and academic papers.
    
-   For each claim that could be sourced online I will attach the primary URL and a short quote (≤40 words).
    
-   When web.run is used I will include up to 5 citations for the most load-bearing claims as required.
    

## Evidence & unknown handling

-   When primary sources are unavailable or contradictory I will mark the field **unknown** and explain why (e.g., private repo, paywalled content).
    
-   I will not guess — any inference will be explicitly labeled as such and linked to the supporting evidence.
    

## Example search-log entry format (what I will deliver)

-   Query: `"enterprise design system architecture survey"`
    
    -   Rationale: broad landscape sweep to locate vendor whitepapers and academic surveys.
        
    -   Result: 12 candidate sources; 3 high-priority (Atlassian blog, IBM Carbon repo, W3C design tokens).
        
    -   Dead-ends: None.
        
    -   Timestamp: 2025-09-17T17:XX:XX-04:00
        

## Quick decision points for you

1.  **Seed companies / repos to prioritize?** (Atlassian, IBM, Salesforce, Shopify, Microsoft, Airbnb, Uber, Atlassian, GOV.UK, US Federal Design System, etc.) — if you don’t specify I’ll use a canonical enterprise list.
    
2.  **Top deliverable you want first?** (Inventory CSV, comparative matrix, or evidence pack). I’ll start with the inventory by default.
    
3.  **Any data sensitivity or NDAs I should respect?** (i.e., do not crawl internal/private docs).

Would you like me to **begin collecting primary sources and start building the CSV inventory now** (I’ll run the seed queries and return the first 20–30 vetted sources + a partial CSV), or do you want to tweak fields/seed organizations first?
