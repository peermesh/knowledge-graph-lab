### 1. Title & Context

**Enterprise Design System Architecture Analysis: A Canonical Synthesis**

This document provides a complete and preserved synthesis of the "Enterprise Design System Architecture Analysis: Comprehensive Research Report" (Source ID: PERPLEXITY). It organizes all original content—including summaries, data tables, academic findings, and recommendations—into a structured format as mandated, ensuring 100% of the source material is preserved and intelligently organized without editorial alteration.

### 2. Foundational Context & Methodology

**From [PERPLEXITY]:**
"This research identifies **monorepo-based modular architectures** as the dominant pattern for enterprise design systems, with **MIT and Apache-2.0 licenses** providing optimal enterprise compliance. The analysis reveals that successful scaling requires **token-first approaches**, **federated governance models**, and **strong documentation practices**. Material Design 3, Carbon Design System, and Microsoft Fluent UI emerge as the leading reference architectures."

**From [PERPLEXITY]:**
"**11 primary queries** across **336 total results** with systematic coverage:
- **Enterprise surveys**: Strong results for architecture patterns and case studies
- **Licensing analysis**: Comprehensive SPDX and enterprise compliance coverage
- **Academic research**: Limited but high-quality peer-reviewed sources identified
- **Dead ends**: Generic enterprise architecture (non-design system), performance-focused scalability studies, governance research lacking design system specificity

**Search quality**: 73% high/medium quality sources, with systematic bias toward industry over academic sources reflecting field immaturity."
