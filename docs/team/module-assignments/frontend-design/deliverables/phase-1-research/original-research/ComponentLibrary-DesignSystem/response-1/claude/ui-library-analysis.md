## G) EVIDENCE PACK

### Market Position & Adoption
- TailwindCSS has crossed more than 78K stars on GitHub and is ruling over NPM trends with more than 8 million+ weekly downloads (WeAreDevelopers, May 2024)
- 66k GitHub stars, making it one of the fastest-growing UI component libraries (Croct Blog, May 2025)
- Park UI is a React component library built on Ark UI and Panda CSS. It is a very new library; it was released in 2024 (Prismic, August 2024)

### Technical Characteristics
- Mantine includes more than 120 customizable components and 70 hooks to cover you in any situation (Mantine.dev)
- Chakra UI shines with its ease of customization and scalability, as demonstrated by its minimal base styles and built-in layout tools (MagicUI)
- Headless UI is a React component library that provides a set of unstyled UI components (Ably, December 2023)

### Licensing
- All products are released under the MIT License (Admin Dashboards, May 2022)

### Developer Experience
- Chakra UI wins over MUI simply because the MUI team has gone over and above to create a comprehensive set of components (Locofy)
- Unlike MUI, it is entirely unopinionated in terms of a design system (Plain English, 2023)

- **Medium:** Moderate dependencies (Chakra UI, Mantine)
- **Low:** Minimal dependencies (Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui)

### Maintenance Risks
- **Low:** MUI, Ant Design, Tailwind (large teams, corporate backing)
- **Medium:** Chakra UI, Mantine (community-driven, sustainable)
- **Higher:** Smaller libraries without clear funding models

### Lock-in Risks
- **High:** Ant Design (unique API patterns)
- **Medium:** MUI (Material Design coupling)
- **Low:** Tailwind CSS, Headless UI (utility/unstyled approach)

### Performance Risks
- **Runtime overhead:** CSS-in-JS libraries (MUI, Chakra UI)
- **Bundle size:** Component libraries with all features
- **Minimal:** Utility-first and tree-shakeable libraries
