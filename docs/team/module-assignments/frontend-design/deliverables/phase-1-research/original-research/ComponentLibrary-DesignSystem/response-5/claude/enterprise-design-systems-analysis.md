### Technical Architecture Evidence  
- "A monorepo is a single repository that houses multiple interconnected yet independent projects. It simplifies development workflows by centralizing code management"

### Governance Insights
- "Integrating rules and governance directly into the design system is crucial. These guidelines serve as the framework that ensures consistent and effective use"

### Scaling Challenges
- "At one point, we counted 22 different design systems floating around. Can you imagine being a new designer or engineer and the answer is 'we actually have 22'?"

### Industry Maturity
- "Enterprise design systems not only streamline the design process and speed up development but also ensure brand consistency across platforms, products, and digital experiences"
