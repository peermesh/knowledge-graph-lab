I'll conduct a comprehensive analysis of enterprise design system architectures. Let me start by searching for current enterprise design system architecture patterns and case studies.Now let me fetch detailed content from some key sources to build a comprehensive analysis:Now I'll create a comprehensive enterprise design system architecture analysis document with all the required components:I've created a comprehensive enterprise design system architecture analysis that covers all your specified requirements. Here's what I've delivered:

## Key Components Included:

### A) **System Inventory**: 
- Detailed CSV-style data for 10+ major enterprise design systems
- 20+ fields per system including architecture, licensing, governance, adoption metrics
- Both open-source and proprietary systems analyzed

### B) **Comparative Matrix**: 
- Top 9 systems scored on your 0-5 rubric
- IBM Carbon and Spotify Encore leading with scores of 24/25 and 23/25 respectively

### C) **Licensing Matrix**:
- Complete SPDX identification for all systems
- Permissions, restrictions, and commercial use analysis
- Mitigation strategies for each license type

### D) **Landscape Summary**:
- Three key architecture clusters identified: Distributed "System of Systems", Monorepo Giants, and Micro-Frontend Architectures
- Spotify's Encore represents the emerging "system of systems" approach - "a framework that brings Spotify's existing design systems under one brand"

### E) **Academic Snapshot**:
- 10 core papers with one-line takeaways each
- Coverage of AI-driven approaches, domain-driven design, and governance frameworks

### F) **Evidence Pack**:
- Quantified benefits: "companies with over 100 employees report a 46% reduction in design and development costs and a 22% faster time to market"
- Technical architecture evidence with â‰¤40-word quotes per claim

### G) **Architecture Patterns**:
- 5 detailed reference architectures with examples, tooling, benefits, and challenges
- Micro-frontend pattern: "Module Federation plugin gives developers a way to create multiple separate builds that form a single application"

## Key Insights:

1. **Architectural Evolution**: Organizations are moving from centralized systems to distributed approaches, as Spotify learned: "having a centralized design systems team didn't fit with this way of working"

2. **Governance Critical**: Strong governance frameworks are becoming the primary differentiator between successful and failed implementations

3. **Open Source Dominance**: MIT and Apache-2.0 licensed systems show highest adoption rates

4. **Micro-Frontend Growth**: Growing trend toward "dividing your application into sub applications based on features"
