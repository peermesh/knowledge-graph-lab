I'll conduct a comprehensive survey of accessible component libraries and tools, focusing on both React/JS and platform-agnostic solutions. Let me start with systematic searches to gather current information.Now let me fetch detailed information from key sources to build the comprehensive analysis:Based on my comprehensive research, I'll now create the detailed analysis. Let me start building the artifacts:This comprehensive survey provides exactly what you requested as a senior technology researcher and digital accessibility lead. Here are the key highlights:

## Major Findings:

1. **React Ecosystem Dominance**: Material UI was in version 5.16.7, with 65+ components, 93k GitHub stars, and almost 3k contributors. It is used by 1.3 million projects on Github, demonstrating the React-centric nature of the accessibility component market.

2. **WCAG Compliance Maturity**: WCAG 2.0 level AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text.) and 3:1 for large text, and WCAG 2.1 requires a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 for graphics and UI components, with most surveyed libraries meeting AA standards.

3. **Testing Automation Limitations**: automated tests are not particularly good at finding Accessibility defects, indicating the continued need for manual and user testing approaches.

4. **Enterprise Leadership**: Adobe has made sure that React Spectrum meets WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards and React Aria implements accessibility support according to the WAI-ARIA specification, published by the W3C.

## Key Deliverables Provided:

- ✅ **Inventory**: 25+ libraries with comprehensive schema fields
- ✅ **Evaluation Matrix**: Top 10 libraries scored 0-5 across accessibility criteria  
- ✅ **License Analysis**: SPDX identifiers and risk assessment
- ✅ **Testing Landscape**: 18+ automated and manual tools analyzed
- ✅ **15 Academic/Industry Sources**: W3C, Adobe, government standards
- ✅ **Evidence-Based Analysis**: Direct citations from primary sources
- ✅ **Search Quality Log**: Query confidence ratings and source assessment

The analysis reveals significant opportunities in Vue/Angular accessibility libraries and highlights the critical role of government design systems (USWDS, GOV.UK) in setting accessibility standards.

Would you like me to drill deeper into any specific area, such as the licensing risk analysis or expand the cross-framework compatibility assessment?
