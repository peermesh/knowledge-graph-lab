# Spark of an idea conversation
**concepts and flow, not implementation details**

So the user needs to be able to sign up for emails and they need to be able to, you know, obviously log in so that they can make custom settings for their deep research results so that they can have them sent by email. They need to be able to choose what they're interested in from some sort of menu, either that, or they're going to have to have an AI prompt, which is probably out of scope because that means another AI agent is on the front end having a conversation with you. So what we're going to do is choose or type in what you want the research to be about. And we will probably need to have a separate section for choosing what kind of output we actually want that in. So we've got the email. Ben's really excited about doing push notifications to your phone, which would be cool if you could get text messages with the latest stuff the moment it happens. I think it would be good to have one more thing, maybe like pushing to a, um, those publishing things like the, the blog, um, companies, I forgot what they are. There's some top blog ones. Um, so we'll figure out what those are. So push to your own blog. Right. And then we also want to be able to, um, turn this off, turn them on. And for each one of those choose the interval. So that's kind of like the part where you're handling the publishing stuff. And we talked about logging in. So that's like the basics, right? That would be a web page, a pretty boring page. But this is called the Knowledge Graph Labs. So maybe we can like play with that lab thing a little bit and have a like a home page where you can choose a couple of different ways of viewing the data. So we've got that one that you found the nodes and points. That'll be great for the the one of the main things that the AI is good at, which is this uh, uh, ontology mapping where you're mapping the, um, two objects together and the line between them, there's a little label on there that says what that relationship is. Like, so if it's birds and flowers, um, or let's say bees and flowers, um, the bees, uh, relationship to the flower is it gets nectar from it. So that's what it's going to say there. And that little note in the middle, And so that's the ontology graph that this AI thing is going to be handing to us. And it'll also be handing us, like, this is all going to be coming in in a single JSON file. 

So it's all going to be coming in in a JSON file. And what we really want is an interface that is dynamic. So whatever the JSON file gives us, we display. and so I'm going to imagine that's probably some sort of hierarchy of content um and one part of the content is going to be like this catalog of of ideas and objects and things and I don't know you may be too young for this maybe not I don't know how the internet is these days but um uh Back in the day, Yahoo was a big deal. And before Google figured out search, Yahoo hired lots of people to create these index or a directory, which was just text with the secondary level of the idea of the text and smaller text underneath it. And you could click on the text or you could click on the subtext, and then it would take you to another page or another view that was like that thing that you just clicked on broken down even further. And that's kind of like how I think this data is going to come across is so, you know, you'll get this like, say we're asking for the creator economy and we're asking for open source. There'll be at the top level open sourcing the creator economy to levels of text under that, Like the most primary, most important ones will come out, you know, so maybe it'll be venues and musicians or something, right, for the creator economy. economy. And on the other one, it'll have like GitHub, recent open source, and, you know, I don't know, different types of open source. And you'll be able to click in and kind of dive into that. And I think what we want to do is figure out a kind of balance where the amount of stuff on the screen isn't too little and isn't too much. And at any level, there's like a little tick box next to the item. And if you click on it, it becomes part of your list of interesting topics. And we'll come up with a better name for that. Typically, you want your interface to be really short words. Um, but yeah, a list of topics that you're interested in and, um, you'll have to somehow be able to take that list of topics and assign it to the things that we're going to receive messages about. So back on that other screen where you can choose the email or the blog posts or the messages, text messages, you'll now have a menu of the things that you chose from that other screen where you could drill down and see what was there and actually pick what was interesting to you. And that'll be really useful information for the backend too, because we'll be able to send those choices back to the server and the AI on the backend that's trying to figure out what everyone's interested in can use those to like create weights for like, oh, there's 20 people that like music. So I guess I'll do a little more research on music. Or, you know, somebody like drills down and they're like, I like R&B mixed with country music or some sort of harmonicas with slam dancing or whatever, like some weird combination that nobody else wants. It'll get in there. There'll be some information about it for that person, but it's not going to spend all day researching harmonicas, right? So like the more people that use it, the better the balance will be on the back end. So we've got this way to like kind of influence and curate what it's doing. Okay. So I think those are two like really basic ways of starting this. And then the other part of this is really being able to give this AI a starting point, a personalized starting point. So when you show up on a blank page, we don't want to overly influence you. What we really want to do is become a very useful tool that it's pretty, it's fun, it's not cluttered with lots of text like my IDE here is. What I was thinking is we do something with bubbles. Have you seen some of those choose your favorites? Oh, I think it's an Apple thing where if you start up Apple Music, the first time you start it up, it doesn't know what you like. I think maybe Spotify does this too, like this sort of onboarding is what they call it, where they ask you. Yeah, they kind of like give you an opportunity to filter out stuff. And I think the good ones actually get a little more information from the user by having two states. So you can like click once and it's like a green circle around the bubble. And that means you like it. And you can click on one twice and it gets a little smaller and a red circle appears around it. And that means you definitely don't want any of that. And suddenly you've got this like opinion, like forming from a really like chill interface. And so like, we'll start with a, like a screen with a one circle in the middle and a plus sign. And there won't be much else to do other than click the plus sign. And when you do that, you get a, you get asked, you know, what do you want in this plus sign? And that's where we'll do that first level of this is what I'm interested in. And so it'll be like the creator ecosystem, right? And you've typed that in. And then the AI, we send a message to the backend saying, get me some research results or no, better. It won't be research results at this point. It'll be get me related ideas to the thing that we're sending back. And I'll, I want about four or five of them. So that'll be like the message we send back. And the AI will then churn a little bit and return with, you know, five different things that are related to the creator economy or ecosystem. And then we'll just display those as like slightly smaller circles, like orbiting the big circle that you just created. And then if you click on them, you add them. If you double click on them, maybe it like asks for more stuff about the thing you just double clicked on. So you can kind of like get more of the things you like through that kind of exploratory mode. And that's a way to build the map of what we understand you're interested in. And then that's great and everything, but some people are very pedantic. They don't want cute interfaces. They just want to type in a thing. 

The idea would be to have like a column on the left. Like this IDE is a very standard affair, right? You break up this square space into areas. So maybe the left-hand side would be like the things that you have refined. So maybe like if you've been on YouTube, the left-hand column is like broken into subsections of this top part is like major subsections of their content, like, you know, videos and shorts and whatever. Yeah, songs. And so like the top level hierarchy of the content. And then underneath that is the Your section, which has the things that you've liked, the things that you've chosen, the things you've watched already. So we'll do something similar like that because everyone will be used to it. It's basically your menu of options. And when you click on something on that left-hand column, it likely will change the main part of the interface. And so I think that's like the basics. And then on the right-hand side, what we'll do is that'll be our filter for like whatever you've selected, you can fine-tune the results, which is very similar to like most software editing packages like video editors and things like that. Whatever you select, you have a way to dial in the values for it. So we'll put that on the right. And then that'll be our basic map of the space that we'll stick to. So in terms of the lab stuff, we can throw that map thing you found in, and that'll be really cool. And people really like that. But to be honest, people like it more. I programmed a few of those because I thought they were so cool. And then nobody used them. because it took a really long time. It's a lot harder than just like, you know, a list. But the problem is the brain doesn't like parsing that stuff. It's like, it just, it sees it as a big blob. It doesn't see it as 20 interesting things. So that's what we're dealing with here is a brain that one of the core design principles is brains like to group things. Um, and they like to chunk things and they like to summarize, uh, instantaneously without you even being conscious of it, what you're looking at. Um, so, uh, we have to be aware of that. And so I think we can do something with this, this model and it's great. Like if you're hyper-focused, if you're using the focus part of your brain, you can read each little piece of text and be like, oh yeah, that's related to that. And that's related to that. And what I want is the thing that's related to that. And then you can do it. You can go for it, right? So I think that's great. We should have that as one of the lab views. And maybe these lab views are on the left-hand column, because that's where all our main choices for how the interface changes is. So we'll have a section that's lab, right? And then we have an opportunity to think about how else can we explore hierarchical ontologies or relationships to content. And that will be, you know, I think we can like leave that as a stretch goal. Like if we have it set up, so there's this one lab thing, that's great. And we'll, if you ask in AI, how else can I display graph data other than the typical way and make it friendly and fun and make it so that you can really discover things you wouldn't have found any other way. What kind of interface elements would do that? That would be our... is the middle part when it's not busy asking you to chase bubbles and like define things in that onboarding process, which you can bring back if you want. You can go back to the bubbles, but like after you've like, after we've like brought you into this thing and you're a daily user, the bubbles might be just tiring. Right. But what you really want in the middle is a feed of the content so um and i think we should borrow um heavily from the billion dollar open ai company that two or three days ago released their um their what do they call it let's see um at the 200 mark i get to see what it's called it's called the pulse it's called pulse okay and And Pulse, I don't know if we can show you. Oh, that's not going to work. You can, if you do a search for chat GPT Pulse. Yeah. And so, yeah, and I just wanted to bring it up because like, I think it's, it's, it's be using it ourselves for free for our own version. We're going to have the chat GPT pulse, but like tuned to our, our wants and it'll be like part of what we're doing, but like our thing's going to like have all these like publishing things that Ben's building. And we're going to be ultimately building in like distributed networks and chat in the future. That's way past what we're talking about here for the record. But like the future, of this thing could be like, you know, PeerMesh can be this like mixture of things that any of these other apps just can't. And so, but this center part for now, I think should be this like feed of reports. So what we, to do that, what we'll need is a interface that's like friendly to the feed scroll user experience, which back when it was invented, with a pain in the ass to program, nobody really knew what needed to happen there. And the nuances were, you know, nobody knew what was going to work. At this point, we've got TikTok and nobody can put it down. Clearly, swipe and then snap and hold um uh pull down to reload uh for the top um interface elements like on the edges for anything that you want to do with that thing like share it save it um put smiley faces on it um whatever uh like the interface elements for the content go on the sides um we'll find a off the shelf probably a react based component that does that whole feed thing for us. And it, there'll be this thing that we, the part that we'll need to figure out is what content do we want in the feed? And like how many, how many, like there'll be some numbers, like, you know, ask for 10 pieces of content at a time. And then like it'll load and then we get near the end of it. It'll ask for the next 10. And that's how you get that kind of seamless thing. It feels like it just goes on forever. And it'll recycle the views because if you don't recycle views, you just end up with a lot of memory overload problems where everything you've loaded is still in memory. So that's part of the magic of a good infinite scroll component is it handles the memory right. And it'll just be calling our server backend API asking for the content. So that should do it, right? That's like a lot. And it would be more than I could put together Certainly you or like, if somebody told me I had to build that right now, But we're going to try some things. We're really going to try some leveraging stuff. And what I've been doing since the last call is thinking about how to go from zero to one. That's a lovely catchphrase in Silicon Valley. It means you didn't have anything. Now you've got something to demo. And that's what everyone wants. Everyone wants that prototype. If you go out into the world, you say you're a programmer, they're like, really? Really? could you like make a prototype for free? And then I'll cut you in. Like, it's like, oh, you mean six months to a year and a half of my time and you like wondering where it is every day? Let me see. I've had, I've got like 30 other offers with the same deal. I don't know. Maybe I should just do it myself. I don't know. I'll think about it anyway. So that's how the world works. Everyone wants a prototype because they can sell a prototype. Although that's all changing with AI. And so what we're going to do is we're doing an experiment here. We're seeing what we can do to leverage AI and become an AI development team. It looks great on the resume. They're going to hire you like that. If you know how to leverage AI and not let it bog you down and create bad code. If instead you can create prototypes after having a one hour conversation and transcribing it, you really will be gainfully employed unless you just feel like becoming a millionaire on your own because, you know, it's that easy. You just like come up with an idea, you talk about it to an AI and the next day the bank is, you know, calling you because there's too much money and they want you to move it into a different account. You know, nice problem to have. So, but these companies are, the people are just, everybody wants that person. Okay. So I want to feed, I want to find our way towards that. So I've been working on that gap. Okay. So I realized there's a tool that has caught on. So what, let me just back up a little bit. So you're looking at, you're looking at the interface here. We've got this AI. who knows what it's going to do with all that text. Really what I wanted to do is save it as a raw capture of my content so I can go back to it and be like, this is my vision. This is my spark, right? Remember I said spark. This is my spark conversation. This is this source of truth for those inevitable moments where you go off and try to build something that I didn't ask for. So that's what it's like right now. But I have found, and I've been doing this AI programming for maybe two years, since it was promised as something that was available, and it sucked back then. So I built up all this stuff, and I'll share all the tools for that. There's a bunch of ways to keep it running down the track. But there's a new thing that I've tried, and I haven't tried it enough yet. It's called SpecKit, and I've mentioned it a few times. and spec kit is from Google or sorry, GitHub. So if you go to github.com slash github slash spec kit, that's their, this thing. And I think it's like a really small team. Just one guy who just got lucky. He's like, everybody loves this thing and I'm getting lots of likes. And I just, it's basically a very opinionated structure for how to take this like long-winded chunk of text and turn it into something that it doesn't get lost building and i've made a bunch of these myself before um and this guy's kind of like hit the sweet spot of like half of spec kit is um like python scripts i think that just do things like create a directory structure with these opinionated directories like plan and you know specifications or whatever I think this one's called constitution so you have to you'll have to get your head around like this guy's weird like world of yeah everyone's gonna have a constitution yeah see um okay and they um will uh once you get around that and you're and i was very skeptical i was like oh this guy's an idiot uh it's gonna it's gonna fail and i watched the youtube video while i downloaded it and before he was done babbling and introducing the introduction of the introduction you know how they are on the youtube this is what i'm about to say and and then after that I'm going to say this other thing. Anyway, before he had actually gotten to the point and shown off the demo, I had run the demo on my machine on a couple of things. Totally seamless. One click from this spec, which was admittedly smaller than what we're building. It was for handling a to-do list or something simple. I should have chosen something else because I'm, yeah, everyone does to-do lists. I just, I was watching the video. So sorry about that. Anyway, we're going to be doing something cooler, but the spec kit is, it has an input and you should go and take a look at like the short list of things that spec kit has. It has like these slash commands. And each one of them handles a stage in the pipeline. So it starts with a constitution, which is, I think, global ideas like, do not make fake data. Do not use this kind of database when I ask for... So these really obvious top-level things. It's basically a set of rules. And we'll probably find that we're sharing that constitution across all of these because we're building these like-minded modules. And then the module is where we're going to be doing our individual work. And so for that, you give it like a... In his example, it's like you type two sentences worth and that's your input. And then it just dreams up this amazing spec. And then afterwards, you're supposed to like tune the spec to make sure it's actually what you want, which I think is a backwards process. So I've actually created a version of spec kit that will input like a big bunch of markdown. So like instead.spec kit, right? And so it has to be somewhere between a few sentences that are kind of going to get you a random result every time and like really terse, like every, like, like really highly opinionated. These are what the names of the database are. And, you know, we don't need to go that far. We need, there's like a sweet spot. And then, so you go through those prompts and then And at the end, it creates a... Part of the magic is it insists on test-driven development, TDD, as the way that you get things done. And as a human, test-driven development is the worst job you could ever have. You basically have to write a test for the thing you haven't written yet. And then you write the code and then you make sure that it passes the test. And then you make sure that if you break your code, that it breaks the test. And then you move on to the next thing. And it's like, ah, you trying to kill us slowly? I guess so. I mean, I guess I will be buying a house at the end of the year. So it's worth it. But yeah, anyway, if you're lucky. And so that's a terrible, it's like horrible. It's such a nightmare working like that, that I've steered away from it most of my life. But it's perfect. It's absolutely perfect. for AI. So, um, because it, it doesn't get tired. It probably, um, needs this because it, what happens is without it, it will make up the results. So you need one thing that is opinionated and is like, it's code. It's not an AI saying, well, I guess you got that right. We'll just tell the user that it was great because they've been asking for it to work for a day now. And, you know, That's how I imagine they think they're chill-brained, not worried about life because they're not alive kind of thing. So the test-driven development is code. It's either going to work or it's not going to work. So this one AI will make the test, and it's not the same AI that's going to have to pass the test. So it's happy making really stringent, you know, strict set of rules and tests. And so it makes all that. And then the next thing that this thing does is it creates the task list, which gets super granular. I think it will just make hundreds of tasks, right, for a long, a big chunk of work. And then it'll run through it. You just say start or whatever the magic command is. And it will start going through the tasks one after another. And you just sort of go get coffee and maybe dinner and, you know, maybe go to bed and get up in the morning and see what happened. So it's like such a casual experience that you could even run it a few times. And we may end up discovering that's part of the process is run it through and see what comes out. And like what I usually do is I'll share the results of an AI with another AI and be like, this is what happened. And I don't like that. Why did that happen? Look at what I gave it. Look at what it produced and find the like little thing in there that led it astray and tell me how to fix it. And typically I'll say, give me a proposal for every single change, why you want it changed, what the change is supposed to do, how you decided that that change was the change I was going to fix it. I get it to think through these things and make a proposal because then it has to use a different part of the logic. It's not doing work. It's making a list of things. And so it's like more concerned about that list and that gives you much better results. And it also gets you keeps you from having this thing just running away with with itself and like editing every file or whatever decides to do, which is, you know, it's not all the time, but it happens. There's a human in the middle who has to check that it's not crazy. And incidentally, we'll still be around. The programmers doing this stuff are going to get much, like the gap between the people who can do this and the people who have no idea what's going on. It's just going to get wider and wider. And that's why I want our team to know how to do this because what we're really becoming is dreamers of the perfect solution, the perfect experience. And that's why I really appreciate you wanting to do this from both angles. You're interested in the code and the design and the interface and the big ball of wax, because that's going to be the job in the future is you go out somewhere in the world, There's a problem out there with real people. And you know that you just have to have a conversation with an AI and run a few scripts through it and you'll be able to solve their problem. And so like the world starts looking different, right? You start seeing things like that's these people really need help. That would be really easy to do, you know, like and it's kind of fascinating. being in the shoes. And after 25 years of looking at the world like that, but having this other thing go off all the time, which was, there's no way in hell you have the time to do yet another interface that's going to take you. How old are you now? Remember when you were young and partying in San Francisco, and then you decided you were going to make a few apps and look at you now. Yeah, so like that's the monologue or inner monologue going on with the programmers up till like two years ago when we were handed the magic keys to the kingdom where it's like, so you know that thing that kept you from doing any of this stuff that you really wanted to do? Yeah, so that's why I've got 12 programs running, building 12 things at once. It's like I'm doing all the cool things. So, yeah, that's the future, right? Is being these like... And so that's why it's so important to understand this. So the last part of this story is this gap, right, between you knowing what you're building and the start of the project and being able to communicate enough to create a PRD. What the hell is that? And like what should be in the PRD. And that's kind of like I've been like learning that too. Like it doesn't need to be that technical. needs to be basically, I think the, um, in the design world, program design, uh, there's, you basically deliver the first thing you deliver to the client after they say, we'll give you the money, um, to build this is a, the design docs. And the, the client has no idea that they've just asked you to do the line share of the work. It's going to kill you to get these design docs done. It's not just one document either. As you get into it, you're like, oh, I need a document that's a list of the assets. I need a document that tracks how the user is. You realize that it's actually like a pile of documents. So the design docs are, one of the design docs is the functional spec. And that's the functions that it has to perform. Like when you click on this, it does that. And then this comes out the other end. And that's distilling it a lot. But that's basically the formula when you're interfacing with a machine. And maybe everything in life, I guess, the cause and effect, right? So cause and effect mapped out for every silly little thing so that when you hand it to your team, instead of them going, I quit, they go, nice, you really, obviously you're a developer, you handed me design docs with everything thought out, which is a wonderful thing to hear. I heard it a few times in my life, it still sticks, like some senior, like, you know, 20 senior my year at the time going, wow, like I rarely get design docs like this. I don't have to like actually do the design doc because you did it this time. Right. So anyway, and that's what you end up knowing once you've had to build it yourself. You're like, oh yeah, I really need to know this stuff. So the feature or the functional spec is really what we're trying to do here. Like you click on that thing, you get this thing out, you click on the sort button, it sorts them by the thing you sorted by. You, you know, you drag the thing to the left and the window pane moves to the left, that kind of stuff. Like some of it is a little too granular. Those examples aren't the best, but you get the point. And so what I'm building in one of the 12 windows is this thing that, did i call it um it's called it's called um product wizard okay so product wizard is like the you know what a wizard is from the i mean obviously you know what a wizard is but like in software terms it's like the friendly interface like one or two buttons um you've got the emoticons or like a shiny chrome look or like i guess apple would make it um you know the weird light bending uh interface gooey elements anyway it's like it looks friendly it's not going to hurt you um and it chunks your decisions down um into bite-sized pieces so that's what i'm doing is creating the product wizard, which actually is the steps between the spec kit when you've got it down, you've got everything, you've got the functional spec, you've got everything thought out, and that moment beforehand where you have no idea, somebody just told you you've got to build something. You've got X number of hours. It's their idea. So if you don't hear from them, you're like, you know, what are you going to do? So like, that's, that's what I'm working on is this sort of exploratory fuzzy logic part at the beginning. So I've been doing a lot of dictating and talking through, like I had a conversation with, with the AI about your point of view and Ben's point of view, who I'm talking to tomorrow. He's probably equally lost and can be just as tired of hearing my voice. Um, but there's, you know, um, we're going to get to the point where we've had the, we've all had the sit down on the couch moment. Um, and there'll be, um, so I've been thinking about like what that fuzzy logic really is. And, um, so that's what I'm trying to do is kind of wrap this up in this neat bow and turn it into like a, a thing that we can use over and over again for that weird beginning point where, you know, I don't know how far I'll be able to get with it, but I'm learning a lot from just like you showing me the dock that you were trying to chew through. And I was like, oh yeah, that's, that's terrible. No, no wonder you didn't know what to do next. That's yeah. So what I, what I think, I think the product wizard needs to say something like, give me the things you just gave your team. And I'm going to like, you know, riddle it with bullets and tell you how terrible you are. And then I'm going to tell you what they really needed, because otherwise they have no idea what to do every other day of the week until they see you that stand up where they're hopefully going to, you know, make it through to the next stand up. And yeah, anyway, like that's, I don't want that to happen. So I'm really thinking about that. And I think that's a big part of what's missing in all of these development environments. You go on and use a vibe coding interface, and if you give it two sentences, yeah, it's going to do the social media app for you, or it's going to make the finance tracker or whatever the hell people get excited about when they fire those things up. But it doesn't lead them through that crucial spark to solid idea with good user interface guidelines and sound logic and breaking up the front end with the back end and how did they talk to each other and what kind of databases. It's not going to do all that for you. It's just going to say you're using Postgres and you're using this and the other thing. And yeah, so I'm kind of excited about that. And I will be showing that off to you, you know, once it's like at a point where it's working, which I'm just starting. I'm going to start with what I've handed you. You're probably not a React expert. I'm not. I actually know the guy who wrote React at Facebook. I worked with him in 2020 on something for like, sorry, in 2000. In San Francisco, we were building like a coding language to replace Flash, which you may or may not know about. But it was like the initial animation interactivity tool. And it got destroyed because it wasn't compatible with browsers. But yeah, so I worked with Adam there. He was really passionate about helping developers. And then he got hired by Facebook and then developed React. And now he's working at Anthropic building AI tools for front end. I'm not quite sure what he's doing there, but he gets really excited about it. And he's like on YouTube interviews, like talking about like the future of coding. So like, yeah, good guy. Makes me want to move back to San Francisco. I tell you some cool cats out there. But yeah. So what was my thought? Oh, yeah. Coding. Sorry. Right. So what we're going to do is we're not vibe coding, which is you don't even look at the code. And we're not hand coding, which is it will take you five days to get one file working properly, maybe two or three. And what you needed was 50, right? So we're going to try to hit that middle ground, which is... And I'm going to be very careful about this because the last thing I want to do is lead you guys down this rabbit hole where AI generates a bunch of slop and it's unmanageable and we can't do anything with it and you don't learn anything from it. Yeah. So there's a middle ground, which is using cursor. But there'll be some discovery, right? And we can start by getting the high level understanding of the code from cursor. And then we can get into the actual programming. And when you open up the files, let's see. You get these file structures here. We don't actually have any code in. This is just the doc section. But Cursor has this predictive thing too. So if you're writing a piece of code, A plus B equals... I guess it's not going to do it because it's a markdown document. But if it was the right coding document, it would give you suggestions. So it's the next step to... Instead of having to code everything, it's going to understand the context of the entire file for you and predict what it was that you were going to type. Or like you had a bunch of things where you had to indent it and change the value somewhere in the code everywhere down through the functions. After you do the first one and you go down, it'll say like hit the tab key to jump to the next instance of this. And because it's already seen, it's already noticed the pattern that you're shifting away from. And it's like predicting, and this is the amazing thing about LLMs and coding is we're working with languages. It's built on trillions of lines of language. Like if nothing else, like the AI is the godsend for the developer, right? And just to back up for a sec, we've been told, and this is like institutionalized now 25 years of programming or whatever. I think I learned C in 97, something like that, 96, but it's been out since like the 80s. No, I think I picked it up early. Like before I went into college, I went, I used to go to the computer bookstore. It was always one, just one in your town. And I bought every book. Like that was like the thing that I collected. And after a while, like they knew who I was. Um, and I had bought every computer book. Like, I think the last stuff I got into was cryptography, which is like, was turned out to be really cool. But, um, like, you know, cause it's just fascinated me. Um, uh, but, but now you, you know, you can use, um, this, this, uh, wealth of knowledge to, to like skip through the books, um, find the thing you need the moment you need it. But like my point is that humans, and the reason I guess I like computer science and programming is humans make this language for humans to make the human's job easier, right? So out of all the sciences out there, this one's actually designed by humans to make it as easy as possible. But what they did is they just created another language between English and binary or assembly language to give you a way to think about logic and structure. And now we've got this different bridge, right, where we can use English language to the weird language someone wrote 30 years ago to get to the assembly language that the computer actually wants. So we're now kind of like doing this odd dance between states, right? Where we've got like, That's the thing you need to know as a developer is logic and... What year of school are you in? I've forgotten. I'm not sure how... What's that? Oh, okay. Wow. Well, you're getting in deep, man. That's great. You're going to be way ahead of the rest of your class. But the fundamentals are absolutely essential. one of the things you need to know is like n scale. Like is it n or is it n times n or is it n times n plus one? What the hell does that mean? It means your computer's running really slow and it's costing a lot of money. But yeah, so you do need to be able to like think about logic and like, you know, the load on your machines and things like that. So we'll still need that like interim step because just having a conversation with a computer and seeing what happens on the outside is like disaster, right? You're just going to end up with some sort of problem. You're either going to be spending a lot of money on compute while it runs through an infinite loop that it doesn't need to. That's there. I want to make sure we address that and we'll make sure we have this, time allowed, well, we can dive into how do we audit this? It turns out AI is great at auditing code because it's language. And so what we'll want to do is have the right language to understand how to audit something. So what do you want to ask a computer about code to make sure that it's functional? Well, there's probably, there's a list of things. Um, there's some books out there, like, uh, dirty, I think it's smelly, smelly, smelly code. Um, which is great, great title, great concept. Smelly code is code that, um, is it's not tight. There's a lot of like variables that point to variables that point to variables before they're used kind of thing. There's lots of like, you know, stuff that doesn't need to be there. So smelly code is stuff that like, probably should have been cleaned up. It's probably going to make it hard to debug in the future. Whether you're a human or an AI, you're going to get stuck on some piece of smelly code, and it's going to be a problem. So like, that's part of it. It's like the book on smelly code and like a couple of other things where they just talk about these patterns of where things really like design patterns that suck, like the things that like take down massive companies because nobody had the time to refactor the code to fix the thing because it was 20 layers deep and everything was dependent on each other. And it was running live the whole time on like, you know, 40 year old computers running cobalt or something which is incidentally how our financial system works uh it's all running on cobalt um and uh like that's why it takes a while for your credit cards to go through is anyway um they're still using floppy disks um for airplanes too by the way uh so um like we you know people are like we're gonna do it this way and that's the way it's gonna be and man floppy disks are cool um and you know now they're like uh i have to get my floppy disks on eBay, literally like the airlines have to buy them on eBay so that they have the thing to stick in when the, the like old machine, like, so like that's smelly, right? It's like dependent on this thing. And if we take that out, the plane doesn't go. So I guess we're just going to keep it in there. So yeah, like those are the patterns that we can like talk to the AI or like look through and like identify and say, where's, where's the ugliness in this? you know, it's working. That's great. How do we make this better? Like, so that'll be like, if we get to that point, that'll be awesome. And before that, what we're going to do is have the, we're using all these like standard programming languages, React, you're going to be using Docker. Like I could tell it to set up Docker and install React and build like the interface we just discussed in way less time than it took me to explain it to. after the PRD is that design phase, which I think is really fun. And this is another part of the research that I really should have... I'm sorry, man, I feel bad, but I really should have added this to the top of the list as well. What we want to do, and maybe I mentioned this, is we know what we want to build kind of right. And now I've got this transcript of what it is. We'll distill that into like a very, like lots of information. It's going to be very useful. And what we're going to do is try to find projects and products and platforms that are on the market that do exactly this. Right. And then, and what is it's in the biz is called competitive analysis. You don't build something in a vacuum thinking it's cool. And then once it's released, your buddy's like, well, you know, this other program is like way better. And I use it every day and it's faster. And they put everything on this screen and it's much cooler. You know, like you don't want that moment. You want the, like, yeah, I know about all these products. In fact, like we adopted the best from all of them. And there were some, some real gaps in that. There were some, we, we even, and one of my tricks is you go to the ratings of the, on the app store where everyone's bitching about the app that your, that your competitor has made. And that's like your, that's, that's the that's the gold right there. Like you just like, oh, let's just solve this list of things that all our competitors like wish they'd thought of before their customers started complaining about it. And we'll just put those in. And now we just contact them and say, you know what? Our product does all that. And it doesn't do these things that you were so pissed off about that you went on to an app store in the middle of your Saturday and bitched about it, you know, like pain points, right? Like so much pain. That's a weird thing about the internet is when by the time somebody is really upset, they're really upset. They're like, I've got to tell somebody, you know, and so like, it's a really good measure of people's sentiment. Like by the time they're bothering, um, it's way beyond the pesky little itch in the back of their head. Um, so it's great. It's good, good data. Right. Um, so we'll, that's what we want to do is like figure out these competitors. We want to look at them from their interface and also like their color schemes. Like, does it work now to look like in, you know, 3D CD button interface? Probably not. It shouldn't look like a Walkman anymore. It probably like, I guess we're going towards flat screen, flat designs, flat color. One thing I like to do is do a search for top design trends of the year that you're in. And then that'll give you like 20 things. 10 of them are unusable, messy garbage. Like, yeah, use catalogs and clip things out and make it look like it's glued together on your screen. No, no, no. Um, but like, there'll be like a few things like these elements are, um, hot right now, or, um, you know, neon green with hot pink, which is actually a thing in the last couple of years is really in the kids are loving it. Um, so like you, you kind of get that. So now you've got like design, you've got like what the conservative, like consumer wants, you've got the, like what the crazy design person who's being paid to write articles thinks will stand out. They've got that gamut. I also look at Webby Awards, things like that, because they have to pick like top sites all the time. So you kind of collect stuff. And back in the day, I used to use Pinterest. That's turned into a nightmare of ads. But like you kind of want to like drop things into like a lookbook, which I guess I'm using Figma more than anything. Like you just do screen captures, drop it into that endless canvas. Then you can kind of like play with it and go back to it whenever you're like, well, what was all you have? There's a button that really did that thing. the same baby blue button with the same rounded recs and the same font that everything else uses. And it's very obvious when a non-designer says, make me an app, and they're like, yay, I have an app now. But what you can do is, we'll get into this, like V0, lovable, even in codecs, or sorry, cursor here. You can drop in images along with your description of the interface and it will use the images, like the color schemes, the shapes as influence for the design. So you can go and get like billboard ads or like things that like are like, you know, do not intersect web interfaces. Like, I don't know, the backs of cereal boxes, right? And drop those in and be like, use these shapes and colors and the arrangement of, you know, fonts as an influence for these pages and then generate from that. And you'll end up with these amazingly different interfaces. So that's the other magic sauce is give it like crazy input, visual input, like your lookbook best bits, which is why you do the lookbook so that when you get to that point where you're like, okay, let's hit the button. Let's see what it can do. You can just pull it from the lookbook because these apps are free. Like the free tier will get you to the point where you've got at least a mockup, which is only that's how far we want to go in most of these. you can you can like tweak the values you can change the image inputs like that you're using and hit go on it like 10 times per platform so you have 50 different functional UI designs which was not the thing when I was doing this like you sat down with a piece of paper and a pencil and you like like the which is a very valuable skill by the way and i had to learn it from uh in my design firm days um like i didn't really get it they're like no sketch it and i started sketching like really refined stuff they're like no no way more like generic circles squares with x's through them you know like lay it out like very rough um and get through those like make a bunch of those at rapid pace instead of spending you know an hour on this one design that you're not going to like or someone else won't like so like iterate quickly um now we can do that like to the point where we go from like a text document to a totally clickable multi-screen you know experience um instead of just like something on a napkin so it's crazy uh this is all like in the last six months to a year. So this is another part of being that like next generation developer creator is, um, this is what the AI is really good at. We're not stealing from somebody's job by like making something that looks like, um, uh, you know, some anime or I forgot what, what it was that, uh, Brimley or so. Yeah.that style for his avatars. Like even though there was so much pushback, he's like, whatever dudes, my lawyer said this is cool. And so like, we're not going to be stealing like that. Like when we use AI like this, nobody's the wiser and they're really benefiting from like the uniqueness of our flow of like cut and paste, slam it together, see what comes out mixed with the research we've done. We know exactly what sticks out, what's going to work. And we'll find some winners in there, right? And then we'll just take those bits, isolate them, and bring them into our coding environment where we can just say, I like this, grab the code from that, turn that into a component, reusable objects. This is going to be our new button. I like the way it glows and animates when you roll the cursor over it, whatever it is. So you start building like this library. And then from there, the rest of the interface is going to like take shape. So, yeah, we'll go through that. I mean, you may have a chance to do it before we get to sit down to do it. But that's a great part of it. like once we've done this research and kind of aligning things so that the inputs are right. That's a lot of fun. So, all right. So sorry. It took so long to get through all that. I think that's it.
