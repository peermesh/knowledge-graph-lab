## üöÄ Getting Started

### Phase 1 Focus
1. Review your research assignment in `assignments/phase-1/`
2. Set up local development environment
3. Create initial Docker Compose configuration
4. Design database schema v1
5. Implement basic authentication

### Key Resources
- **Research Assignment**: See `02b-phase-1-research-assignment.md` in this directory
- **Docker Best Practices**: [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/develop/dev-best-practices/)
- **Database Comparison**: Research different database types for different use cases
- **API Design Patterns**: Compare REST, GraphQL, and other API approaches

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Local-First**: Everything runs on a developer's machine in Docker
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add complexity only when needed
3. **API-Driven**: Clear contracts between all components
4. **Stateless Services**: Horizontal scaling from day one
5. **Security by Default**: Authentication, authorization, audit logging built-in

### Technology Research Areas
- **Language & Framework**: Python vs Node.js vs others for multi-module APIs
- **Database Strategy**: Single database vs multiple databases for different data types
- **Caching Layer**: When and how to implement caching (Redis vs others vs none)
- **Async Processing**: Message queue options for AI workloads and publishing
- **Container Strategy**: Docker composition patterns for multi-module systems
- **API Documentation**: Auto-generation approaches for team coordination
- **Testing Strategy**: Approaches for testing multi-module integrations

## üìö Learning Path

**Docker & Containerization:**
- Start with Docker Compose basics
- Focus on multi-container applications
- Learn volume management and networking

**API Design:**
- Study RESTful principles
- Learn about API versioning
- Understand authentication patterns

**Database Architecture:**
- Compare database types for different data requirements
- Schema design principles across database types
- Migration and integration strategies for multi-database systems

**System Architecture:**
- Microservices vs Monolith trade-offs
- Message queue patterns
- Caching strategies

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-engineering Phase 1**: Keep it simple initially
2. **Ignoring local-first requirement**: Don't require cloud services
3. **Poor API documentation**: Others depend on your APIs
4. **Tight coupling**: Maintain clean module boundaries
5. **Security as afterthought**: Build it in from the start
6. **No monitoring**: You can't fix what you can't see
