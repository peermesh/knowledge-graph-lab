# Backend Architecture: Phase 1 Deep Dive

**Scope**: Optional reference for advanced backend patterns beyond Phase 1 MVP. Use [02b-phase-1-research-assignment.md](02b-phase-1-research-assignment.md) for immediate implementation tasks.

## Advanced Infrastructure Topics

### Production-Grade Infrastructure


#### Message Queuing
- **Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Streams**: Enable event-driven architectures, async job processing, and dead letter queues

Research message queue integration patterns:

- When do applications benefit from adding message queuing?
- What are the trade-offs between different queuing systems (Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka)?
- How to determine if async processing is necessary for your use case?
- What patterns exist for handling failed messages and dead letter queues?

#### Advanced Monitoring
- **APM**: Application performance monitoring with tools like New Relic or DataDog
- **Distributed tracing**: Request tracking across services with Jaeger or Zipkin
- **Log aggregation**: Centralized logging with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Custom metrics**: Business and technical dashboards

#### CI/CD Pipelines
- Automated testing strategies
- Blue-green deployments
- Rollback mechanisms
- Infrastructure as code

#### Rate Limiting & Throttling
- API rate limiting strategies
- Queue management
- Resource allocation
- DDoS protection

### Advanced Development Support

#### Service Infrastructure
- **Service mesh** (Istio, Linkerd)
- **Container orchestration** (Kubernetes)
- **Secrets management** (Vault, Sealed Secrets)
- **Distributed caching** strategies

#### Implementation Decision Points
- **Need indicators**: 1000+ daily active users, 10+ services, or 24/7 uptime requirements
- **Cost factors**: Additional infrastructure, team training, operational complexity
- **Migration path**: Start with monitoring, add queuing for async tasks, implement tracing last

## Modular Architecture Patterns

### PeerMesh-Style Component System

#### Component Architecture
- **Plugin-style installation**: WordPress-like simplicity for adding/removing features
- **Component boundaries**:
  - **Data boundaries**: Each component owns specific database tables
  - **API boundaries**: Versioned endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/knowledge-graph/`)
  - **Runtime boundaries**: Separate Docker containers or processes
- **Dynamic loading**: External modules, hot-reload, automatic dependency resolution

Research component architecture patterns:

- How do successful plugin systems define component boundaries?
- What metadata is essential for component registration and discovery?
- How to handle component dependencies and version conflicts?
- What patterns enable safe component installation and removal?

#### Component Types
- **Modules**: Headless capabilities (data, APIs, events)
- **Plugins**: App-wide features with routes
- **Widgets**: User-configurable UI components
- **Integrations**: External service connectors

#### Migration System Requirements
- Install/uninstall flows for components
- Database migrations per component
- Rollback capabilities
- Zero-downtime upgrades

### Content-Addressable Code Modules


#### Content-Addressed Storage
Modules use cryptographic hashes for identification, enabling immutable references, deduplication, and trustless verification.

Investigate content-addressable storage concepts:

- How do systems like Git and IPFS use content addressing?
- What are the benefits of cryptographic hashes for module identification?
- How does content addressing enable trustless verification?
- What are the trade-offs between content addressing and traditional versioning?

#### Technologies to Explore
- **Nix package manager** (content-addressed derivations)
- **IPFS** for distributed module storage
- **Docker content trust**
- **Git's content-addressable object model**

#### Service-Based Modularity
- Single responsibility per module
- Language-agnostic interfaces (gRPC, REST)
- Container-based isolation
- Service mesh communication

#### Service Boundaries
- **Data ownership**: Each service manages its own database/schema
- **API-only communication**: No direct cross-service database access
- **Versioned interfaces**: Backward-compatible API evolution

Research service communication patterns:

- What are the best practices for inter-service authentication?
- How to design API contracts between services?
- What are effective patterns for service versioning?
- How to handle service discovery and routing in modular architectures?

## API Abstraction Strategies

### Core API Abstraction


#### Unified API Gateway
- **Single entry point**: All module interactions through one gateway
- **Smart routing**: Configuration-based request routing to appropriate services
- **Version management**: Handle API deprecation and migration
- **Protocol translation**: Convert between REST, GraphQL, gRPC

Investigate API gateway configuration strategies:

- How do API gateways handle request routing and load balancing?
- What are effective patterns for authentication and rate limiting at the gateway level?
- How to implement smart routing based on request characteristics?
- What are the trade-offs between different gateway solutions?

#### Module Registry
- Dynamic module discovery
- Capability registration
- Dependency resolution
- Health monitoring

#### Module Communication Patterns
- **Request/Response**: Direct API calls with timeout
- **Publish/Subscribe**: Event-driven async communication
- **Command/Query Separation (CQRS)**: Separate read/write paths
- **Saga Pattern**: Distributed transactions
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fault tolerance

Research event-driven architecture patterns:

- How do successful platforms implement publish-subscribe patterns?
- What are the best practices for event naming and payload design?
- How to ensure event delivery reliability and ordering?
- What patterns exist for handling event replay and debugging?

### Configuration-Driven Management

#### Dynamic Module Features
- **Module hot-swapping**: Change implementations without restart
- **Feature flags**: Enable/disable modules per user/group
- **A/B testing**: Route percentage of traffic to different modules
- **Gradual rollout**: Progressive module deployment
- **Fallback chains**: Multiple implementation options

#### API Versioning Strategies
- **URL versioning**: `/api/v1/entities`, `/api/v2/entities` (recommended)
- **Header versioning**: `Accept: application/vnd.api+json;version=2`
- **Query parameter**: `GET /api/entities?version=2`
- **Content negotiation**: Support JSON, XML, or Protocol Buffers based on Accept header

## Database Scaling Patterns

### When Multiple Databases Make Sense


#### Specialized Database Types
- **Search engines** (Elasticsearch): Advanced text search, faceted queries, real-time indexing
- **Document stores** (MongoDB): Schema-less JSON documents, nested data structures
- **Time-series** (InfluxDB/TimescaleDB): High-frequency metrics, IoT data, analytics
- **Graph/Vector**: Neo4j and vector databases covered in Phase 2

Research time-series database patterns:

- When do applications need specialized time-series databases?
- What are the trade-offs between PostgreSQL extensions and dedicated time-series databases?
- How to design effective schemas for time-series data?
- What are the best practices for data retention and aggregation policies?

#### Database Selection Criteria
- **Use PostgreSQL when**: ACID transactions, complex queries, structured data
- **Use Elasticsearch when**: Full-text search, log analysis, faceted navigation
- **Use MongoDB when**: Rapid prototyping, document-centric data, flexible schemas
- **Use TimescaleDB when**: Time-series data, real-time analytics, IoT metrics

#### Scaling Decision Framework
- **Consistency**: Use event sourcing or saga patterns for multi-database transactions
- **Architecture**: Database-per-service for microservices, shared for monoliths
- **Cross-database queries**: API composition or materialized views, avoid JOIN across databases

## Advanced Authentication Concepts

### Advanced Authentication Patterns

- **Hardware attestation**: TPM-based device verification and cryptographic proofs
- **Decentralized identity**: DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and Verifiable Credentials
- **Zero-knowledge**: Authentication without revealing credentials
- **Web3 integration**: MetaMask, WalletConnect, and blockchain-based auth
- **Biometric**: Beyond device unlock - server-side biometric verification

### Deployment Strategy
- **Container boundaries**: Separate containers for different languages, scaling requirements, or failure domains
- **Docker Compose organization**: Group related services, use networks for isolation, environment-specific overrides
- **Database strategy**: Containers for development, managed services (RDS, Atlas) for production
- **Service extraction criteria**: Different scaling needs, team boundaries, or technology stacks
