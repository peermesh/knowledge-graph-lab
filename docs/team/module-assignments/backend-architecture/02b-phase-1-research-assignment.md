# Backend Architecture Research Topics
**For**: Backend Architecture Team Member

---

## Your Focus Area

You'll be designing and implementing the core backend infrastructure that powers the entire Knowledge Graph Lab system. This includes data pipelines, database architecture, deployment strategies, and authentication systems.

---

## Research Philosophy & Process

### ðŸŽ¯ Depth-First Distillation Approach

Your research should explore the full spectrum of backend architecture - from simple Express servers to how Discord handles 15 million concurrent users, how Uber processes 100+ petabytes of data, and how Netflix achieves 99.99% uptime. Understanding these enterprise-scale implementations will inform your architectural decisions, even if your initial implementation is simpler.

**Research Organization**:
Your research will naturally span from basic implementations to enterprise-scale systems. Document everything you find - from simple tutorials to how major tech companies solve these problems at scale. Your research summary will help determine what's achievable within our timeline.

### ðŸ“š Research Process

**Follow the complete research methodology**: See [Research Guide](../../research-guide.md) for the 6-step process including how to use AI tools, organize findings, and synthesize results.

**Remember**: Research broadly (everything from SQLite to Spanner), implement pragmatically (what works within the project phases).

## Topic 3: Authentication & Authorization

### Core Authentication Architecture
Research different approaches to auth systems:
- **All-in-one solutions**:
  - Supabase (includes database + auth + realtime, open-source available)
  - Firebase Auth (Google ecosystem, has free tier)
  - AWS Cognito (AWS ecosystem, pay-per-use)
- **Dedicated auth services**:
  - Auth0/Okta (enterprise-grade, but has costs)
  - **Keycloak** (open-source, self-hosted, FREE)
  - **FusionAuth** (community edition available, FREE)
  - **Ory** (cloud-native, open-source, FREE self-hosted)
  - Clerk (modern but paid service)

**Priority**: Focus on open-source, self-hostable solutions (Keycloak, Ory, Supabase open-source) for maximum flexibility

### Supabase vs Separated Best-in-Class Auth
**Critical decision**: Should auth be bundled with database or use dedicated auth service?

**Supabase approach (bundled)**:
- **Pros**:
  - Open-source version available (self-hostable)
  - Integrated Row Level Security (RLS)
  - Single service to manage
  - Built-in user management UI
  - Realtime subscriptions with auth
- **Cons**:
  - Couples database and auth concerns
  - May not have all auth features of dedicated services
  - Limited to PostgreSQL for RLS benefits

**Separated best-in-class approach**:
- **Pros**:
  - Use most feature-rich auth service (Auth0, Okta)
  - Better enterprise features (SSO, advanced MFA)*
  - More authentication provider options
  - Database-agnostic
  - Cleaner separation of concerns
- **Cons**:
  - More services to manage
  - Need to implement authorization layer
  - Higher complexity
  - **Service limitations** (Auth0, Okta have tier restrictions)

  - Shared public content if needed
- **Keep it simple**:
  - No need for complex multi-tenant architecture
  - Just basic user accounts and permissions
  - Can add teams/groups later if needed

### Token Management
- **Token types**:
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
  - Opaque tokens
  - Refresh/access token patterns
  - Session tokens
- **Token storage**:

### Authorization Patterns
- **Access control models**:
  - RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
  - ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)*
  - ReBAC (Relationship-Based Access Control)**
  - Policy-based authorization**
- **Simple authorization**:
  - User owns their data
  - Admin role for system management
  - Public/private content flags

### Implementation Considerations
- **Session management**:
  - Stateless vs stateful sessions
  - Session storage (Redis, database)
  - Cross-service session sharing*
  - Session timeout strategies
- **Security best practices**:
  - OWASP authentication guidelines

### What You're Building
**Goal**: Design a system that can reliably import research content from multiple sources into our knowledge graph.

The team member needs to research how to build a pipeline that:
1. **Accepts input** from users (file uploads, URLs, API connections)
2. **Processes content** (extract text, metadata, relationships)
3. **Stores it properly** in our database for the AI to use

### Core Research Areas

#### Input Methods

- Use Redis or database queue for job management
- Process one item at a time initially
- Add parallel processing later if needed*

**Key decisions to research**:
- Synchronous (wait for result) vs asynchronous (background job)
- How to show progress to users
- Error handling and retry strategies
- File size and rate limits

#### Content Processing Steps
What happens to each piece of content:
1. **Validation**: Is this a supported format? Is it within size limits?
2. **Extraction**: Pull out text, metadata, structure
3. **Enrichment**: Add timestamps, source info, user tags
4. **Storage**: Save to appropriate database tables
5. **Indexing**: Prepare for search and AI processing

### Integration with AI Pipeline
**Critical**: This connects to the AI team member's work
- Extracted text needs to be ready for embedding generation
- Metadata must support RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Consider how to handle updates to existing content
- Plan for incremental processing of large documents

### Key Questions to Answer
- What's the simplest way to handle file uploads reliably?
- Should processing be real-time or batch?

### Module Verification & Trust
**Understanding existing verification systems**:
- **How current tools verify packages**:
  - npm/yarn package checksums
  - Docker image signatures
  - Git commit hashes
  - Package manager lock files
- **Why research this now**:
  - If we use external packages, we'll understand verification options
  - If we create reusable PeerMesh components later, we'll know how to make them verifiable
  - Understanding the landscape helps inform architecture decisions

### Implementation Considerations
- **Docker deployment strategy**:
  - Which components need their own containers?
  - How to organize services in Docker Compose?
  - Database containers vs managed services?
- **Package management strategy**: 
  - How to ensure reproducible installs (lock files)
  - Understanding package verification (npm, pip, etc.)
- **Custom code decisions**:
  - When is code significant enough to be its own service?
  - When should we just write glue code?
  - Do we need to package anything for PeerMesh reuse?

### Key Questions
- How do package managers handle verification today?
- What are the trade-offs of different verification approaches?
