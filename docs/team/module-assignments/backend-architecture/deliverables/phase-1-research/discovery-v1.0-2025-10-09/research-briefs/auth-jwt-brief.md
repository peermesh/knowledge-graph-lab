## Context
[Describe user authentication requirements]
[Security and compliance needs]
[Integration with frontend and external services]

## Requirements (Criteria, Not Brands)
- Authentication methods: [JWT/sessions/OAuth/SSO requirements]
- Token management: [refresh tokens, expiration handling]
- Multi-factor auth: [required/preferred/optional]
