# Research Brief: API Framework Selection

## Context
[Describe the API requirements and complexity]

[Expected traffic patterns and scale]

[Integration requirements with other services]

## Requirements (Criteria, Not Brands)
- Programming language: [Python/Node.js/Go/etc or open]
- Async/await support: [required/preferred/optional]
- Auto-documentation: [OpenAPI/Swagger generation]
- Request validation: [schema validation requirements]
- Performance: [requests per second, response time targets]
- WebSocket support: [real-time requirements]
- GraphQL support: [if needed for complex queries]

## Constraints
- Budget: [open-source only / commercial OK]
- Team expertise: [language familiarity, framework experience]
- Timeline: [development velocity requirements]
- Platform: [deployment environment]
- Dependencies: [must integrate with existing stack]

## Research Objectives
Find ALL production-ready API frameworks meeting criteria above.

For each option, document:

- Feature completeness vs requirements
- Performance benchmarks
- Developer experience and learning curve
- Ecosystem maturity (libraries, tooling)
- Community support and documentation quality

## Output Format
Comparison matrix ranked by fit to criteria, with recommendation and rationale.
