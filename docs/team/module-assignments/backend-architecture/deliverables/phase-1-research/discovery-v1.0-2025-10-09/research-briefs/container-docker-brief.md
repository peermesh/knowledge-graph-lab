# Research Brief: Container Platform Selection

## Context
[Describe deployment and orchestration requirements]

[Expected scale and environment complexity]

[Development vs production needs]

## Requirements (Criteria, Not Brands)
- Container runtime: [Docker-compatible / open to alternatives]
- Orchestration: [needed for production scale]
- Local development: [ease of dev environment setup]
- CI/CD integration: [automation requirements]
- Expected scale: [number of services, nodes, concurrent users]
- Auto-scaling: [horizontal/vertical scaling needs]
- Service mesh: [advanced networking requirements]

## Constraints
- Budget: [open-source only / managed service OK / enterprise OK]
- Team expertise: [containerization experience / DevOps skills]
- Timeline: [time to production deployment]
- Platform: [cloud provider lock-in tolerance]
- Complexity tolerance: [operations team size and skills]

## Research Objectives
Find ALL production-ready container platforms meeting criteria above.

For each option, document:

- Feature completeness for requirements
- Operational complexity
- Cost analysis (development + production)
- Learning curve and documentation
- Ecosystem maturity (tools, integrations)

## Output Format
Comparison matrix ranked by fit to criteria, with recommendation and rationale.
