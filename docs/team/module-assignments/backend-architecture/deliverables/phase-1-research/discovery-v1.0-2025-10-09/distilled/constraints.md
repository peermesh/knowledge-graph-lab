- Source: work-description.md:150

---

## Timeline Constraints

**MVP Deadline:**
- 100 hours total effort allocated for backend MVP

## Team Constraints

**Team Size:**
- Single backend developer (intern initially)
- Source: work-description.md:1-12, pr-review context

**Expertise Level:**
- Junior developer capability expected

- Performance testing and benchmarking
- Source: pr-review.md:60-85

---

## Platform Constraints

**Local-First Requirement (CRITICAL):**
- Everything must run on developer's machine in Docker
- No cloud dependencies for core functionality
- Progressive enhancement: add cloud services only when needed
- Source: work-description.md:150-151

**Containerization:**
- Must use Docker/Docker Compose
- All services containerized from day one
- Source: work-description.md:14, PRD.md:14

**Operating System:**
- Must support macOS, Linux, Windows (Docker-compatible)
- Source: Inferred from local-first requirement

**Development Environment:**
- Docker Compose for multi-service orchestration
- Volume mounts for live code reloading
- Source: docker-compose.yml:1-37, work-description.md:1057-1058

**Infrastructure:**
- No specific cloud platform mandated
- Start with local Docker, migrate to cloud later if needed
- Source: work-description.md:150-151

## Technical Constraints

### Database

**MVP Constraints:**

- Must support migration path to PostgreSQL + Neo4j (production)
- Source: PRD.md:35, Backend-Architecture-Spec.md:10-11

**Production Future:**
- PostgreSQL with pgvector for embeddings
- Neo4j for graph relationships (if essential)
- Redis for caching (when needed)
- Source: WHAT-SERVICES-TO-CHOOSE.md, BASIC-RESEARCH.md:206-269

### Performance Targets

**Response Times (Documented):**
- Simple Query P95: ~200ms (target: <200ms SLO 99%+)
- Complex Search P95: ~800ms (target: <800ms SLO 95%+)
- Graph Traversal P95: ~400ms (target: <400ms SLO 95%+)
- Source: success-metrics.md:15-18

**Processing Capacity:**
- Daily source processing: Thousands of sources
- Ingestion rate: ≥50 docs/min (from abstraction scaffold)
- Concurrent users: Hundreds of simultaneous sessions
- Source: success-metrics.md:43, abstraction-scaffold acceptance tests

### Scalability

**MVP Scope:**
- Single-instance deployment acceptable
- Stateless service design for future horizontal scaling
- Source: work-description.md:154

**Future Scaling:**
- Horizontal scaling via container orchestration
- Kubernetes for production (Phase 2+)
- Source: Backend-Architecture-Spec.md:46

## Scope Constraints (MVP vs Future)

### MVP Scope (100 Hours)
- 5 RSS feeds ingestion
- 5 REST API endpoints
- SQLite database
- JWT authentication
- Docker containerization
- Basic monitoring (health checks)
- Mock AI integration
- Source: PRD.md:13-25

### Out of MVP Scope
- Production database scaling (PostgreSQL + Neo4j)
- Advanced authorization (SpiceDB/OPA dual-layer)
- Event-driven architecture (NATS JetStream)
- Distributed consistency (CRDT integration)
- Multiple interlinked graphs (hypergraphs)
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- Advanced observability (distributed tracing)
- Source: PRD.md:25-30, abstraction-scaffold future vision

### Intentionally Deferred
- Integration planning with other modules (flagged gap)
- Database schema design/ERD (flagged gap)
- Architecture diagram (flagged gap)
- Performance benchmarking (flagged gap)
- Production security hardening (prototype stage)
- Source: pr-review.md:60-85

---

## Resource Constraints

**Compute Resources:**
- Development: Developer's local machine (laptop/desktop)
- No GPU requirements for MVP (mock AI responses)
- Source: PRD.md:16, work-description.md:150

**Storage:**
- SQLite file-based storage (no separate DB server)
- Docker volumes for persistence
- Source: PRD.md:35, docker-compose.yml:35-36

**Network:**
- Internet required for RSS feed fetching
- No inbound network requirements (local development)
- Source: PRD.md:13

---

## Quality Constraints

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests expected (not explicitly required in MVP)
- Integration tests mentioned (not specified)
- Acceptance tests defined in abstraction scaffold (p95 < 350ms @ 100k chunks)
- Source: work-description.md:162, abstraction-scaffold README.md:224-233

**Documentation Requirements:**
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger) required
- Code comments expected
- Architecture documentation missing (flagged gap)
- Source: BASIC-RESEARCH.md:624-628, pr-review.md:70

**Code Quality:**
- No specific linting/formatting standards mentioned
- Python type hints suggested (not required)
- Source: Inferred from modern Python best practices

---

## Architectural Constraints

**Design Principles (Must Follow):**
1. **Local-First**: Run entirely on developer machine
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Simple first, complexity only when needed
3. **API-Driven**: Clear contracts between components
4. **Stateless Services**: Horizontal scaling from day one
5. **Security by Default**: Auth, authorization, audit logging built-in
- Source: work-description.md:148-154

**Patterns Required:**
- Module template pattern (consistent service structure)
- Health/readiness endpoints for all services
- Structured JSON logging
- Source: abstraction-scaffold AGENTS.md:155-167

**Patterns Avoided:**
- Monolithic architecture (use modular services)
- Hardcoded configuration (use environment variables)
- Synchronous blocking for long operations (use async patterns)
- Source: BASIC-RESEARCH.md:885-888, 954-998

## Known Gaps & Risks

### Critical Gaps Identified
1. **Integration Architecture**: How backend connects to AI/Frontend/Publishing (missing)
2. **Database Schema**: No ERD, no CREATE TABLE statements (missing)
3. **Architecture Diagram**: No system diagram produced (missing)
4. **Performance Analysis**: No benchmarks or profiling (missing)
- Source: pr-review.md:60-75

### Risk Factors
1. **Minimal Research Effort**: 8-10 hours vs 20-30 expected (low confidence in depth)
2. **Docker Security Issues**: Hardcoded secrets, no health checks, no resource limits
3. **Scope Creep Risk**: Aspirational scaffold features could bleed into MVP
4. **Single Developer Risk**: No redundancy, knowledge silos
