## 🚀 Core Deliverables (Read These First)

### 1. Component Map (`component-map.md`)
**Purpose:** Your implementation checklist

**What's inside:**
- **10 MVP components** you MUST build (database, API, auth, Docker, etc.)
- **10 future components** you should DOCUMENT but NOT build (PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Redis, etc.)
- Integration points with AI, Frontend, Publishing modules

**Use this for:** Breaking down the 100-hour MVP into concrete tasks

---

### 2. Distilled Files (`distilled/` directory)

These 5 files replace 50+ pages of scattered source material:

#### **`vision-statement.md`** (4 pages)
- Problem: Creators waste 10+ hours/week searching for opportunities
- Solution: Backend continuously collects, stores, serves information
- MVP scope: 5 RSS feeds, SQLite database, 5 REST endpoints
- Future vision: Distributed P2P, Four-Plane Architecture, permission propagation

**Key takeaway:** Backend is **infrastructure for other modules**, not end-user facing.

#### **`requirements-notes.md`** (4 pages)
- **10 functional requirements** (FR-1 to FR-10): Feed fetching, storage, APIs, health checks
- **Non-functional requirements:** <200ms response time, 99.9% uptime, Docker deployment
- **Gap analysis:** What's unclear and needs to be decided

**Key takeaway:** Clear, testable requirements for each component.

#### **`technical-context.md`** (4 pages)
- Technology options for each component (databases, APIs, auth, deployment)
- Trade-off analysis: MVP simplicity vs production scale
- Patterns and prior art from similar systems

**Key takeaway:** Why certain technologies fit the 100-hour MVP constraint.

#### **`constraints.md`** (3 pages)
- **Budget:** 100 hours, junior developer skillset
- **Platform:** Docker-based, local-first, no cloud vendor lock-in
- **Timeline:** MVP must work in 1-2 weeks
- **Technical:** Performance targets, security baselines, integration limits

**Key takeaway:** Boundaries that prevent scope creep.

#### **`decisions-made.md`** (4 pages)
- **10 FIRM decisions:** SQLite, FastAPI, JWT, Docker, REST, Python `schedule`, etc.
- **5 TENTATIVE decisions:** PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Redis (for future, not MVP)
- **5 OPEN decisions:** GraphQL?, Message queue?, CRDT?, etc.
- **7 REJECTED approaches:** Django, monolith, hardcoded config, sessions, etc.

**Key takeaway:** Know what's decided, what's still open, what's explicitly ruled out.

## 📝 Research Briefs (`research-briefs/` directory)

These are **research templates** used during discovery. They're included for transparency:

- **`database-sqlite-brief.md`** - Why SQLite for MVP (file-based, zero config, SQLAlchemy compatible)
- **`api-framework-fastapi-brief.md`** - Why FastAPI (async, OpenAPI, type hints)
- **`auth-jwt-brief.md`** - Why JWT tokens (stateless, REST-friendly)
- **`container-docker-brief.md`** - Why Docker (isolated, reproducible, single command deploy)

**Use these for:** Understanding the research methodology and criteria-based evaluation approach.

---

## 📊 Process Documentation (`process-docs/` directory)

**For transparency:** How this bundle was created.

- **`PHASE1-COMPLETE.md`** - Full 108-minute process timeline, quality assessment, lessons learned
- **`AGENT2-SESSION-SUMMARY.md`** - Second agent's work (sub-agent delegation pattern)
- **`2025-10-09-13-26-handover-backend-wo0-context-intake.md`** - Agent handover notes

**Read these if:** You want to understand the discovery process or replicate it for other modules.

## ✅ What's Already Decided (FIRM Decisions)

These technology choices are **locked in** for MVP:

| Component | Technology | Why |
|-----------|------------|-----|
| Database | SQLite | File-based, zero setup, easy migration to PostgreSQL later |
| API Framework | FastAPI | Async, OpenAPI auto-generation, type hints |
| Authentication | JWT tokens | Stateless, REST-friendly, works across microservices |
| Container Platform | Docker | Isolated deployment, single command to run |
| API Design | REST (5 endpoints) | Simple CRUD, no GraphQL complexity |
| Scheduler | Python `schedule` | Hourly RSS fetches, no external cron |
| Health Checks | `/health` endpoint | Container liveness/readiness probes |
| Configuration | Environment variables | No hardcoded secrets, 12-factor app |
| API Docs | FastAPI OpenAPI | Auto-generated `/docs` endpoint |
| Logging | Python `logging` | Stdout logs (Docker captures) |

**Total:** 10 components with firm technology choices.

---

## ❓ What's Still Open (Need Decisions)

These questions need answers **during** or **after** MVP:

1. **GraphQL?** - Should we add GraphQL alongside REST for complex queries?
2. **Message Queue?** - Do we need NATS/Kafka/RabbitMQ for async processing?
3. **CRDT?** - For distributed data sync (future P2P architecture)
4. **Authorization?** - OAuth2, RBAC, attribute-based access control?
5. **Vector DB Scaling?** - How to scale embeddings beyond SQLite (pgvector? dedicated vector DB?)

**Don't solve these now.** Focus on the 10 FIRM decisions for MVP.

---

## 🚧 What NOT to Build (Out of MVP Scope)

These are **explicitly deferred** to post-MVP:

- PostgreSQL + pgvector (use SQLite for now)
- Neo4j graph database (document graph use cases, don't build)
- Redis caching (add when performance becomes bottleneck)
- Keycloak advanced auth (JWT tokens sufficient for MVP)
- Kubernetes deployment (Docker Compose for now)
- Prometheus/Grafana monitoring (basic logging sufficient)
- CI/CD pipeline (manual deployment for MVP)
- Message queue (NATS/Kafka) - sync processing for MVP

**Why this matters:** Prevents scope creep, keeps MVP under 100 hours.

## 📞 Questions?

**If something is unclear:**
1. Check `distilled/decisions-made.md` - Is it a FIRM, TENTATIVE, or OPEN decision?
2. Check `distilled/constraints.md` - Does it violate a known constraint?
3. Check `component-map.md` - Is it MVP or FUTURE scope?
4. Ask the team lead - Some decisions require human judgment

**Common questions answered:**
- **"Should I use PostgreSQL?"** No, use SQLite for MVP. PostgreSQL is TENTATIVE for production.
- **"Do I need Redis caching?"** No, out of MVP scope. Add when performance is measured as bottleneck.
- **"GraphQL or REST?"** REST for MVP (5 endpoints). GraphQL is OPEN for future.
- **"How many components?"** 10 MVP components (must build) + 10 future components (document only).
