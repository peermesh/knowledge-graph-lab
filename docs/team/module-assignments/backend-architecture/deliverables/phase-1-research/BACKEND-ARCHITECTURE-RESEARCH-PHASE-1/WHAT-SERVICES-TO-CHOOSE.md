# High-level Comparison (When to Pick Each)

## PostgreSQL (structured + relational) (CHOOSE THIS) ##

**Best when:** transactional integrity, normalized relational data, complex SQL, joins, ACID, and you want to colocate structured data with vectors (`pgvector`).  

**Strengths:** mature SQL, strong tooling, transactions, rich indexing, extensions (`pgvector`, HNSW plugins), easy operational model if you already run Postgres. `pgvector` + modern index options handle medium-scale vector workloads well.  

*Supabase* ✅ +1  

**Weaknesses:** scaling to very large vector corpora (many millions of vectors at high QPS) requires careful sharding or external tools; very large single-row payloads hit TOAST/block limits unless using quantization.  

*thenile.dev*  

---

## MongoDB (documents + vector search)

**Best when:** document-first data model, flexible schema, need to store vectors alongside documents natively and run mixed queries (text + vector + filter) in same DB. Atlas Vector Search supports ANN and quantization.  

*MongoDB* ✅ +1  

**Strengths:** unified document + vector search, flexible, scales horizontally via sharding.  

**Weaknesses:** document model may not suit heavy relational traversals; vector features and performance depend on Atlas / recent features.  

---

## Neo4j (graph / relationships) ##

**Best when:** heavy connected data, deep/complex traversals (multi-hop queries), graph analytics, relationship-centric queries where traversal performance trumps plain storage.  

**Strengths:** graph query language (Cypher), optimized for traversals, graph algorithms.  

*Medium* ✅ +1  

**Weaknesses:** transactional node+edge creation can be slower than bulk import; large scale inserts/updates require tuning or bulk import tools (`neo4j-admin import`) and careful schema/index use — achieving 1k related inserts in <100ms in transactional mode is unlikely without bulk import.  

---

## Redis (in-memory cache, sessions, ephemeral state, RedisSearch)

**Best when:** caching, session store, ephemeral counters, leaderboards, sub-ms lookup. Redis also offers RedisSearch/Vector indexes for small/fast ANN workloads, but it’s primarily an in-memory store.  

*Redis* ✅ +1  

**Strengths:** extremely low latency, simple key-value operations, excellent for session caching in front of any DB.  

**Weaknesses:** persistence/durability tradeoffs (depends on config), memory cost if storing many vectors.  

# High-level Comparison (When to Pick Each) API

## FastAPI (async)

**Best when:** modern Python async apps, high-performance APIs, automatic docs generation, developer productivity.  

**Strengths:** async-first design, automatic OpenAPI & Swagger docs, type hints → validation, excellent performance (close to Node/Go in many cases).  

*FastAPI* ✅ +1  

**Weaknesses:** less “batteries included” than Django REST — you often need to add auth, admin, and ORM integrations yourself.  

---

## Django REST Framework (batteries-included) (CHOOSE THIS) ##

**Best when:** large apps needing full-stack features (auth, admin, ORM, serialization, permissions) and rapid prototyping with opinionated structure.  

**Strengths:** built on Django (ORM, auth, middleware, templates), mature ecosystem, well-tested in production at scale, robust permissions/serialization.  

*Django REST* ✅ +1  

**Weaknesses:** heavier than FastAPI/Flask, slower out-of-the-box performance, more ceremony around setup, async support is improving but not native-first.  

---

## Flask (lightweight)

**Best when:** microservices or small APIs, minimal boilerplate, maximum flexibility, quick proof-of-concepts.  

**Strengths:** lightweight, simple, huge ecosystem of extensions, flexible architecture.  

*Flask* ✅ +1  

**Weaknesses:** no built-in async, no automatic docs (need plugins), less opinionated so you must assemble your own stack (auth, validation, ORM, docs).  

---

# Example Benchmark

- **Task:** Build identical CRUD endpoint in each framework.  
- **Measure:**  
  - Response time (latency under load).  
  - Documentation quality (generated OpenAPI spec).  
- **Target Benchmark:** Generate OpenAPI spec with **<5 manual steps**.  
  - **FastAPI:** ✅ Automatic (0–1 steps).  
  - **Django REST:** ⚠️ Requires DRF + drf-spectacular or drf-yasg (≈3–5 steps).  
  - **Flask:** ❌ Needs third-party libs (e.g. flasgger, apispec) and manual wiring (>5 steps).


# High-level Comparison (When to Pick Each) Container Orchestration

## Docker Compose (local)

**Best when:** local development, small projects, quick multi-service setup, testing environments.  

**Strengths:** extremely simple config (`docker-compose.yml`), one command (`docker compose up`) to start everything, great for dev/test.  

*Docker Compose* ✅ +1  

**Weaknesses:** not designed for production scaling, lacks built-in service discovery across hosts, limited orchestration features.  

---

## Kubernetes (production scale) (CHOOSE THIS) ##

**Best when:** large-scale production workloads, need auto-scaling, self-healing, rolling updates, multi-node clusters, and cloud-native ecosystem integration.  

**Strengths:** powerful orchestration, service discovery, scaling, secrets/config maps, ecosystem (Helm, operators, monitoring), runs anywhere (cloud, on-prem).  

*Kubernetes* ✅ +1  

**Weaknesses:** steep learning curve, complex YAML/config management, higher ops overhead, slower iteration speed for small dev teams.  

---

## Docker Swarm (simple clustering)

**Best when:** small-to-medium deployments, need clustering beyond a single machine but don’t want Kubernetes complexity.  

**Strengths:** easier than Kubernetes, integrates directly with Docker CLI, provides service discovery, scaling, load balancing.  

*Docker Swarm* ✅ +1  

**Weaknesses:** less active community, fewer features vs Kubernetes, not as widely adopted in enterprise, limited ecosystem compared to K8s.  

---

# Example Benchmark

- **Task:** Start all services (DB, API, Redis, queue worker) with a single command.  
- **Measure:**  
  - Startup time (all containers healthy and able to talk).  
  - Inter-service communication.  
- **Target Benchmark:** Services start and communicate in **<30 seconds**.  
  - **Docker Compose:** ✅ Typically <10s on a dev machine.  
  - **Kubernetes:** ⚠️ May take 20–30s+ depending on cluster size and readiness checks.  
  - **Docker Swarm:** ✅ Usually within ~15s, simpler networking than K8s.

# High-level Comparison (When to Pick Each) Authentication Method

## JWT (stateless)

**Best when:** APIs that need stateless authentication, horizontal scaling (no shared session store), and mobile/SPA clients.  

**Strengths:** self-contained token, no server storage required, easy to use across services, widely supported.  

*JWT* ✅ +1  

**Weaknesses:** token revocation is hard (must wait for expiry or use blacklist), larger token payload adds overhead, must secure signing keys carefully.  

---

## Session Cookies (server state) ##

**Best when:** traditional web apps, SSR (server-side rendered) sites, environments where server-side session storage is fine.  

**Strengths:** simple and well-understood, built-in browser support (cookies), easy revocation (delete session server-side), integrates with frameworks easily.  

*Session Cookies* ✅ +1  

**Weaknesses:** requires centralized/shared session storage in distributed systems, less suited for stateless APIs, cross-domain scenarios require CORS/cookie config.  

---

## OAuth (third-party) (CHOOSE THIS) ##

**Best when:** integrating with external identity providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft), enabling SSO, or delegating trust to external services.  

**Strengths:** standardized, secure delegation, avoids managing passwords directly, supports social login and enterprise SSO.  

*OAuth* ✅ +1  

**Weaknesses:** implementation complexity, more moving parts (redirects, tokens, refresh flows), dependent on third-party availability.  

---

# Example Benchmark

- **Task:** Implement login flow with **90% of routes protected by default**.  
- **Measure:**  
  - Middleware overhead.  
  - Ease of protecting most routes out-of-the-box.  
- **Target Benchmark:** Auth middleware adds **<10ms per request**.  
  - **JWT:** ✅ Typically adds only a few ms for signature verification.  
  - **Session Cookies:** ✅ Simple DB/Redis lookup <5ms with proper caching.  
  - **OAuth:** ⚠️ Request-time verification is still <10ms, but flow complexity is higher (more steps to implement correctly).  

# High-level Comparison (When to Pick Each) Message Queue System

## Redis (simple)

**Best when:** lightweight queueing, small-to-medium workloads, real-time or ephemeral tasks where durability isn’t critical.  

**Strengths:** extremely fast (in-memory), simple commands (`LPUSH`, `BRPOP`), widely supported client libs, can add retry logic with minimal code.  

*Redis* ✅ +1  

**Weaknesses:** persistence optional (AOF/RDB), not designed for guaranteed delivery, may lose jobs if node crashes without proper config.  

---

## RabbitMQ (reliable) (CHOOSE THIS) ##

**Best when:** enterprise systems that need guaranteed delivery, acknowledgments, flexible routing (topics, fanout), and complex retry/backoff policies.  

**Strengths:** robust, durable queues, supports message acknowledgments and retries, strong ecosystem and management UI, battle-tested in production.  

*RabbitMQ* ✅ +1  

**Weaknesses:** more operational complexity than Redis or DB table, slower than Redis (disk + acknowledgments), requires extra infra.  

---

## Database Table (MVP)

**Best when:** minimal setups or MVPs where introducing a new queueing system isn’t justified; jobs can live in an existing relational DB.  

**Strengths:** easy to implement (just a table + `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`), leverages existing infra, durable by default, transactional with app data.  

*Database Table* ✅ +1  

**Weaknesses:** poor performance at scale, risk of DB contention/locking, no built-in retry/backoff, not horizontally scalable for high throughput.  

---

# Example Benchmark

- **Task:** Queue **100 file processing jobs**, handle failures gracefully with retry logic.  
- **Measure:**  
  - Throughput (jobs/minute).  
  - Reliability (no job lost).  
- **Target Benchmark:** Process **50 jobs/minute** with retry logic.  
  - **Redis:** ✅ Easy to exceed 50/min; add retry by re-queuing failed jobs.  
  - **RabbitMQ:** ✅ Durable queues handle retries and acknowledgments natively; meets benchmark reliably.  
  - **Database Table:** ⚠️ Possible at small scale (50/min is fine), but retry logic is manual and may cause DB contention under load.
