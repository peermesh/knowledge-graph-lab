## Research Philosophy & Process

### 🎯 Depth-First Distillation Approach

Your research should explore the full spectrum of AI development - from simple regex patterns to how OpenAI serves ChatGPT to 100M users, how Google's PaLM handles trillion-parameter models, and how Anthropic ensures AI safety at scale. Understanding these cutting-edge implementations will inform your architectural decisions, even if your initial implementation uses smaller models.

**Research Scope**:
Explore everything from basic implementations to cutting-edge enterprise solutions. Document all findings comprehensively; your research summary will help determine what's achievable within our timeline while maintaining awareness of best-in-class approaches.

### 📚 Research Process

**Follow the complete research methodology**: See [Research Guide](../../research-guide.md) for the 6-step process including how to use AI tools, organize findings, and synthesize results.

**Remember**: Research broadly (from rule-based to neural networks), implement pragmatically (what runs locally in Docker).
