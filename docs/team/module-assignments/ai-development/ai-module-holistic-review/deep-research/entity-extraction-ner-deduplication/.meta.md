gap: "Unknown whether traditional NER libraries (spaCy, Flair, Hugging Face) can match LLM quality for entity extraction, and what deduplication approach achieves 99%+ precision without merging different entities. Need comparison of NER + LLM hybrid vs pure LLM, plus fuzzy matching vs semantic embedding strategies."
impact: "NER libraries could reduce costs significantly if quality matches LLMs. Entity deduplication prevents duplicate nodes in graph which breaks queries and confuses users. False positives in deduplication create cascading quality problems."

## Research Metadata

**Research Track:** 05-entity-extraction-research (Part 2: NER & Deduplication)
**Topic:** Traditional NER Libraries vs LLM and Entity Deduplication Strategies

### Research Objectives

1. **NER vs LLM?** Can traditional NER libraries match LLM quality for entity extraction?
2. **Hybrid Approach?** Does spaCy preprocessing + LLM validation outperform pure LLM?
3. **Deduplication Precision?** Which approach achieves 99%+ precision (avoid merging different entities)?
4. **Deduplication Recall?** Can we catch 95%+ of duplicate entities?
5. **Cost Tradeoff?** Is NER+LLM hybrid more cost-effective than pure LLM?

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Benchmarked at least 3 NER libraries (spaCy, Flair, HuggingFace)
- [ ] Compared NER vs LLM vs hybrid on same dataset
- [ ] Tested fuzzy matching and semantic embedding deduplication
- [ ] Achieved 99%+ precision in entity deduplication
- [ ] Documented cost comparison (NER vs LLM approaches)
- [ ] Clear recommendation: NER, LLM, or hybrid approach

### NER Libraries to Evaluate (Minimum 3)

1. **spaCy** - Pre-trained models, fine-tuning capability, speed
2. **Flair** - Multi-task learning NER, context-sensitive embeddings
3. **Hugging Face Transformers** - DistilBERT/RoBERTa for NER
4. **Hybrid Approach** - spaCy preprocessing + LLM validation

### Research Methodology

**NER Evaluation:**
- Test each library on 200-sample benchmark dataset
- Measure F1 score per library and entity type
- Compare speed (entities per second)
- Assess memory footprint and model size
- Test fine-tuning on domain-specific entities
- Compare to LLM baseline from Part 1

**Deduplication Testing:**
- Implement fuzzy matching (Jaro-Winkler, Levenshtein)
- Implement semantic matching (SentenceTransformers)
- Create test dataset with known duplicates
- Measure precision (false positive rate)
- Measure recall (false negative rate)
- Test at different similarity thresholds

**Evaluation Dimensions:**
- Accuracy: F1 score on entity extraction
- Speed: Entities per second (NER), latency (LLM)
- Cost: Model deployment vs API calls
- Deduplication precision: % merged pairs actually same
- Deduplication recall: % actual duplicates found
- Integration complexity: Ease of deployment

### Expected Output

≥3,000 word technical report including:
- NER library comparison matrix (F1, speed, cost)
- NER vs LLM vs hybrid accuracy comparison
- Deduplication precision/recall by approach
- Cost analysis: NER deployment vs LLM API
- Hybrid approach design and performance
- Clear recommendation with implementation guidance
