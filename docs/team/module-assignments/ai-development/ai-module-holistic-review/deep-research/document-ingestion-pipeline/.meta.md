gap: "Unknown which parser combination achieves 90%+ accuracy for PDF, HTML, and text extraction with acceptable latency (<10 sec per page). Need to determine optimal chunking strategy and boilerplate removal approach that preserves semantic meaning without degrading downstream entity extraction quality."
impact: "Document ingestion is the pipeline entry point. Poor text extraction directly degrades entity extraction quality. Slow parsing adds latency to every document. Determines whether we can process documents in real-time or require batch preprocessing."

## Research Metadata

**Research Track:** 04-document-ingestion-research
**Topic:** Document Parsing, Chunking, and Preprocessing Pipeline

### Research Objectives

1. **Parser Selection?** Which parsers achieve 90%+ accuracy for PDFs and HTML?
2. **Chunking Strategy?** What chunking approach preserves semantic meaning for entity extraction?
3. **Boilerplate Removal?** How do we remove navigation/ads while keeping important content?
4. **Edge Cases?** How do we handle scanned PDFs, tables, code samples, multi-column layouts?
5. **Performance?** What's acceptable latency (target <10 seconds per document)?

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Evaluated 4+ PDF parsers with accuracy benchmarks
- [ ] Evaluated 3+ HTML parsers with boilerplate removal
- [ ] Tested 3+ chunking strategies with downstream impact
- [ ] Achieved 90%+ extraction accuracy on text documents
- [ ] Handled 10+ different document formats cleanly
- [ ] Documented edge cases and failure modes
- [ ] Clear parser recommendations with integration plan

### Parsers to Evaluate (Minimum 4 for PDF, 3 for HTML)

**PDF Parsers:**
1. **pdfplumber** - Layout-aware parsing, table extraction
2. **PyPDF2** - Text extraction, metadata handling
3. **Unstructured** - Unified interface for multiple formats
4. **Cloud OCR** - Google Vision/AWS Textract for scanned PDFs

**HTML Parsers:**
1. **Trafilatura** - Boilerplate removal, main content extraction
2. **BeautifulSoup** - CSS selectors, parsing flexibility
3. **Newspaper3k** - Article extraction, metadata

### Research Methodology

**Parser Testing:**
- Create diverse test set (20-30 documents)
- Academic PDFs, web articles, technical docs, scanned PDFs
- Measure extraction accuracy per document
- Benchmark parsing latency
- Document failure modes and edge cases
- Test table and code sample preservation

**Chunking Evaluation:**
- Implement 3+ chunking strategies
- Fixed-size vs semantic vs hybrid
- Measure impact on entity extraction quality
- Test overlap strategies
- Assess performance overhead

**Evaluation Dimensions:**
- Accuracy: % of text extracted correctly
- Latency: Seconds per page/document
- Robustness: Handles malformed/unusual documents
- Edge cases: Tables, images, multi-column, scanned
- Memory usage: Peak memory during parsing
- Integration: Ease of Python integration

### Expected Output

≥3,000 word technical report including:
- Parser accuracy matrix with per-document results
- Performance benchmarks (latency distributions)
- Chunking strategy recommendations with examples
- Boilerplate removal effectiveness assessment
- Edge case analysis and handling strategies
- Pipeline architecture design
- Integration guidance and cost model
