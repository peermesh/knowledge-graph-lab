gap: "Unknown cost-latency tradeoffs for research orchestration at scale. Need analysis of source integration options (web search, academic APIs, documentation), cost per research task, and infrastructure requirements to inform budget planning and source selection strategy."
impact: "Research orchestration costs determine system economics. Wrong source mix or inefficient agent patterns could make system unaffordable. Cost analysis drives source integration decisions and influences framework choice."

## Research Metadata

**Research Track:** 03-research-orchestration-research (Part 2: Cost Analysis)
**Topic:** Research Orchestration Cost Analysis and Source Integration

### Research Objectives

1. **Source Selection?** Which data sources (web, academic, docs) provide best cost-quality tradeoff?
2. **Cost Modeling?** What's the cost per research task broken down by component?
3. **Infrastructure?** What infrastructure is needed to support orchestration at scale?
4. **Scaling?** How do costs scale with query volume (100, 1K, 10K queries/day)?
5. **Optimization?** What caching and batching strategies reduce costs?

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Evaluated at least 4 data sources with cost and quality metrics
- [ ] Built complete cost model per research task
- [ ] Documented infrastructure requirements and costs
- [ ] Created scaling projections for different volumes
- [ ] Clear source integration recommendations
- [ ] Identified optimization opportunities (caching, batching)

### Data Sources to Evaluate (Minimum 4)

1. **Web Search APIs** - Google Search API, Bing Search API, SerpAPI, DuckDuckGo
2. **Academic APIs** - PubMed, arXiv, Semantic Scholar, CrossRef
3. **Documentation Sources** - ReadTheDocs, GitHub, Stack Overflow APIs
4. **Real-time vs Batch** - Performance and cost tradeoffs

### Research Methodology

**Source Evaluation:**
- Test each source with representative research queries
- Measure latency, cost, quality of results
- Assess coverage (what % of queries answered)
- Document API limits and reliability
- Test deduplication and relevance scoring

**Cost Modeling:**
- LLM costs: token usage per research task
- API costs: per-query pricing for each source
- Infrastructure: compute, storage, networking
- Scaling analysis: cost growth with volume
- Optimization impact: caching and batching savings

**Evaluation Dimensions:**
- Coverage: Does source have relevant information?
- Quality: Signal-to-noise ratio of results
- Cost: Per-query or subscription pricing
- Latency: Response time and rate limits
- Reliability: Uptime and fallback options
- Freshness: How current is the information

### Expected Output

≥3,000 word technical report including:
- Source comparison matrix with cost and quality metrics
- Complete cost model per research task
- Infrastructure requirements and costs
- Scaling projections at 100/1K/10K queries per day
- Caching and optimization strategies
- Source integration recommendations
- Budget planning guidance
