## üèóÔ∏è AI Architecture Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Accuracy First**: Better no answer than wrong answer
2. **Cost-Conscious**: Optimize token usage and model selection
3. **Explainable**: Show reasoning and sources
4. **Iterative**: Continuous improvement through feedback
5. **Ethical**: Respect privacy, avoid bias, ensure fairness

### Research Focus Areas
