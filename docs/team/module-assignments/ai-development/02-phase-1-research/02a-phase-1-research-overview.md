# AI Development Phase 1 Research

Optional Advanced Topics: see [02c-phase-1-research-advanced.md](02c-phase-1-research-advanced.md)

## What You're Building

You'll implement the intelligence layer of the Knowledge Graph Lab - the system that transforms raw information into structured knowledge and actionable insights. This includes entity extraction, research automation, and reasoning capabilities.

## Critical Requirement: Everything Runs Locally

**The entire AI system MUST run locally in Docker containers on a developer's machine**

- No cloud APIs required for Phase 1 functionality
- OpenAI/Anthropic APIs optional for Phase 2
- All core features work offline
- Single `docker-compose up` to start everything

## Research Objectives

You need to research and make recommendations for:

1. **LLM approach** (GPT-4, Claude, Llama) vs traditional NLP (spaCy, NLTK)
2. **Entity extraction strategy** - Prompting vs fine-tuning vs hybrid approaches
3. **Relationship extraction methods** - How to identify connections between entities
4. **Confidence scoring approaches** - How to assign reliability scores to extracted data
5. **Cost optimization strategies** - Balance quality with budget constraints
6. **Vector database selection** - For storing and querying embeddings
7. **Knowledge graph construction** - Building relationships from extracted entities

## Specific Research Tasks

### RAG Architecture Research
- [ ] Set up simple document chunking (1000 tokens with 200 overlap)
- [ ] Test text extraction from PDFs and documents
- [ ] Compare embedding generation options (OpenAI ada-002 vs Sentence Transformers)
- [ ] Evaluate Qdrant for vector storage (Backend will provide this)
- [ ] Build semantic similarity search prototype (top-k retrieval)
- [ ] Create basic prompt templates with context injection
- [ ] Test source citation methods

### LLM Orchestration Research
- [ ] Build simple LLM chains (prompt → LLM → output)
- [ ] Test sequential chains for multi-step tasks
- [ ] Create basic prompt templates
- [ ] Implement output parsers for structured data
- [ ] Compare frameworks: LangChain vs LlamaIndex vs DSPy
- [ ] Test basic agent with ReAct pattern
- [ ] Evaluate memory systems (conversation buffer for Phase 1)

### Entity and Relationship Extraction
- [ ] Compare GPT-4, Claude, and open-source models (Llama 2 7B, Mistral 7B) for entity extraction
- [ ] Test extraction accuracy on 10 sample documents (PDFs, research papers, grant applications, news articles, blog posts)
- [ ] Measure precision/recall metrics: target >85% precision, >80% recall for key entities (people, organizations, grants, technologies)
- [ ] Evaluate cost per document for different approaches (target: <$0.05 per document)
- [ ] Research graph construction from extracted entities with relationship confidence scores (0.0-1.0)
- [ ] Investigate confidence scoring methods using model logits, ensemble voting, and human validation samples
- [ ] Test structured output formats (JSON, XML, custom) with schema validation
- [ ] Research incremental learning approaches for continuous model improvement
- [ ] Evaluate vector databases for semantic search with similarity thresholds and retrieval metrics

### Cost Analysis
- [ ] Calculate processing costs for 10,000 documents daily (target: $50-100/day)
- [ ] Compare API costs (OpenAI: ~$0.02/1K tokens, Anthropic: ~$0.015/1K tokens vs local: ~$0.001/1K tokens)
- [ ] Evaluate local model deployment costs (hardware: 16GB RAM minimum, GPU optional)
- [ ] Research caching strategies to reduce API calls
- [ ] Test batch processing for efficiency

## Deliverable Format

Create a research brief with:

1. **Executive summary** - Key findings and recommendations in one page
2. **Model comparison matrix** - Accuracy and cost metrics for each approach (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 2, Mistral)
3. **Proof-of-concept** - Extract grants from 5 sample documents (NIH grants, NSF proposals, startup pitches)
4. **Cost projections** - Detailed breakdown for different scales (1K, 10K, 100K documents/day)
5. **Recommended approach** - Your technology choices with justification
6. **Technical risks** - What could go wrong and mitigation strategies
7. **Integration plan** - How your choices work with other modules
8. **Learning resources** - What you'll need to study for Phase 2

## Phase 1 Foundation Requirements

Your Phase 1 implementation must:

- Run entirely on local machine in Docker
- Process documents with basic RAG pipeline
- Extract entities from text
- Work without cloud APIs
