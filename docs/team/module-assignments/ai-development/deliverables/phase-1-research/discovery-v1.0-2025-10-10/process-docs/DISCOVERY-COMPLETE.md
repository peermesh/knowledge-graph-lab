## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk

- **Tech Stack:** Python/FastAPI/Docker are proven, team familiar
- **Basic NER:** spaCy is well-established
- **Cloud APIs:** OpenAI API is production-ready
- **Architecture:** Microservices + events is standard pattern

### Medium Risk

- **Cost Management:** Need careful monitoring to stay within $0.10/doc target
- **Accuracy Targets:** 90%+ accuracy is challenging but achievable
- **Integration Complexity:** 3 other modules to coordinate with
- **Scaling:** 10x throughput increase (100 → 1000 docs/hour) requires optimization

### High Risk

- **Self-Hosted LLMs:** Complex, requires GPU ops expertise (Phase 5)
- **Entity Resolution:** Hard problem, 90% accuracy is ambitious
- **Hallucination Control:** < 5% hallucination rate requires validation
