## Decisions Already Made

### Decision 1: Tech Stack - Python/FastAPI
**Sources:** `docs/modules/ai-development/PRD.md` (lines 32-39)

**Decision:** Python 3.11 + FastAPI + spaCy + OpenAI API + Docker

**Rationale:** FastAPI provides fast, modern async API development. Python has best AI/ML library ecosystem. Docker ensures consistent deployment.

**Status:** [x] Firm [ ] Tentative [ ] Needs validation

**Evidence:**
```
### Stack
- Python 3.11
- FastAPI
- spaCy (for local NER)
- OpenAI API (Phase 2)
- Docker
```

---

### Decision 2: Mock-First Implementation Strategy
**Sources:** `docs/modules/ai-development/PRD.md` (lines 10-11, 109-132)

**Decision:** Build with mock responses first (Phase 1), add real AI later (Phase 2)

**Rationale:** Saves API costs during development, allows infrastructure testing without AI dependency, enables parallel work by Backend team

**Status:** [x] Firm [ ] Tentative [ ] Needs validation

**Evidence:**
```
## Goals (MVP)
1. Create API that accepts text and returns entities
2. Start with hardcoded mock responses
3. Add real entity extraction in Phase 2

## Mock Implementation Strategy
### Phase 1: Pattern-Based Mocking
Simple pattern matching for mock responses without AI API costs

### Phase 2: Real AI Prompts
OpenAI integration for actual entity extraction
```

---

### Decision 3: Microservices Architecture
**Sources:** `docs/design/system/architecture.md` (lines 5-40)

**Decision:** Microservices architecture with 5 independent services including dedicated AI Processing Service

**Rationale:** Enables parallel development, service isolation, independent scaling, resilience through loose coupling

**Status:** [x] Firm [ ] Tentative [ ] Needs validation

**Evidence:**
```
# System Architecture

## System Components

Knowledge Graph Lab uses a microservices architecture designed for scalability
and maintainability:

### 2. AI Processing Service
- Extracts meaningful entities from normalized content
- Identifies and maps relationships between entities
- Applies confidence scoring to extracted information
```

---

### Decision 4: Event-Driven Communication
**Sources:** `docs/design/system/architecture.md` (lines 88-107)

**Decision:** Event bus (RabbitMQ) for inter-service communication with async processing

**Rationale:** Loose coupling, retry mechanisms, audit trails, service resilience, asynchronous processing for better performance

**Status:** [x] Firm [ ] Tentative [ ] Needs validation

**Evidence:**
```
### Event-Driven Architecture
Services communicate through an event bus that enables:
- Asynchronous processing for better performance
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Dead letter queues for error handling
- Event replay for system recovery
- Audit trails for compliance
```

---

### Decision 5: Separation of Concerns - AI generates, Backend stores, Publishing distributes
**Sources:** `docs/design/system/ai-publishing-integration.md` (lines 115-133)

**Decision:** Clean separation: AI generates standalone reports with URLs, Backend stores them, Publishing queries and distributes

**Rationale:** Prevents tight coupling, enables independent scaling, clear responsibility boundaries, supports multiple distribution channels

**Status:** [x] Firm [ ] Tentative [ ] Needs validation

**Evidence:**
```
## Separation of Concerns

### AI Module
- Generates complete, standalone news reports
- Uses prompts to write in journalistic style
- Has no knowledge of subscribers or emails
- Each report is self-contained with its own URL

### Backend
- Stores all reports with metadata
- Provides query interface for report retrieval

### Publishing Module
- Queries reports based on subscriber preferences
- Decides which reports to include in emails
```

---

### Decision 6: Multi-Model Strategy
**Sources:** `docs/modules/ai-development/AI-Development-Spec.md` (lines 35-40), `docs/team/module-assignments/ai-development/01-work-description.md` (lines 176-180)

**Decision:** Use multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, open models) with selection logic based on task requirements

**Rationale:** Avoids vendor lock-in, enables cost optimization (use cheaper models for simple tasks), provides fallback options, allows A/B testing

**Status:** [x] Firm [ ] Tentative [ ] Needs validation

**Evidence:**
```
### Model Management
- Model Selection: Choose between GPT-4, Claude, Llama based on task requirements
- Fine-tuning: Improve models for specific extraction tasks when needed
- Version Control: Track model versions and performance metrics

**Research Focus Areas:**
- LLM Strategy: OpenAI vs Anthropic vs open models (Llama, Mistral)
```
