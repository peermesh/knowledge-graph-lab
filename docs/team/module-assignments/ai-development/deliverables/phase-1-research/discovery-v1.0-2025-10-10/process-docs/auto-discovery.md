## Quality Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Documentation:** All major aspects covered
2. **Consistency:** No contradictions between sources
3. **Specificity:** Quantitative targets and explicit decisions
4. **Clarity:** Module boundaries clearly defined
5. **Traceability:** Decisions linked to sources and rationale

### Identified Gaps

**No critical gaps identified.**

Minor notes:

- Phase-specific research assignments exist but weren't prioritized (lower relevance for initial discovery)
- User journeys cover AI use cases but not AI-module-specific implementation details (appropriate separation)

### Contradictions

**None found.** Documentation is consistent across all sources.

---

## Confidence Assessment

**Overall Confidence: 9/10**

**Confidence Breakdown:**

- Vision content: 10/10 (comprehensive vision doc)
- Requirements: 9/10 (primary spec excellent, PRD marked non-canonical but valuable)
- Technical: 9/10 (architecture complete, implementation details in PRD)
- Constraints: 10/10 (explicit quantitative targets)
- Decisions: 9/10 (all major decisions documented with evidence)

**Why not 10/10:**

- PRD marked "non-canonical" introduces minor uncertainty about authority
- Some implementation details (like exact prompt templates) are TBD
- Research phase outputs not yet available (expected)

**Confidence is sufficient for Discovery Kit execution.**
