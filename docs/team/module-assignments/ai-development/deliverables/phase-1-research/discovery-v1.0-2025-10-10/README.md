## 🚀 Core Deliverables (Read These First)

### 1. MVP Plan (`guides/AI-MODULE-2-WEEK-MVP.md`) ⭐ **START HERE**
**Purpose:** Your realistic 2-week implementation plan

**What's inside:**
- **10 working days** (80 hours), **one developer**
- Self-contained Docker module with FastAPI + spaCy
- Just HTTP in, JSON out (entities extracted)
- **NO** vector databases, graph databases, event buses, or expensive APIs
- Day-by-day timeline
- Success criteria: 60-70% accuracy (acceptable for MVP)

**Use this for:** Actually building something in 2 weeks

---

### 2. Component Map (`component-map.md`)
**Purpose:** Your technology checklist

**What's inside:**
- **7 MVP components** you MUST build: Python, FastAPI, spaCy, Docker, Pydantic, uvicorn, pytest
- **19 future components** you should DOCUMENT but NOT build: OpenAI API, Vector DB, Graph DB, Redis, etc.
- Integration points with Backend, Frontend, Publishing modules (for future)

**Use this for:** Understanding scope boundaries

---

### 3. Distilled Files (`distilled/` directory)

These 5 files replace 50+ pages of scattered source material:

#### **`vision-statement.md`**
- Problem: Creator economy information chaos (10+ hrs/week wasted searching)
- Solution: AI-powered entity extraction and knowledge graphs
- AI Module's role: Transform unstructured text into structured knowledge
- Why now: LLMs, graph DBs, compute costs converged

**Key takeaway:** AI module is the **brain** of Knowledge Graph Lab.

#### **`requirements-notes.md`**
- **8 functional requirements:** Entity extraction, relationships, confidence scoring, pipeline, reports, etc.
- **Accuracy targets by phase:** 80% (Phase 3) → 90% (Phase 4) → 95% (Phase 5)
- **Throughput targets:** 100 → 500 → 1000 docs/hour
- **Module boundaries:** What AI owns vs. doesn't own

**Key takeaway:** Clear requirements with quantitative success criteria.

#### **`technical-context.md`**
- Microservices architecture (5 services, AI is Module 2)
- Event-driven communication (RabbitMQ)
- 8-stage processing pipeline
- Mock-first development strategy
- Integration contracts with other modules

**Key takeaway:** Technical architecture and integration patterns.

#### **`constraints.md`**
- **Timeline:** 2 weeks for MVP (80 hours, one developer)
- **Cost:** Free tools only for MVP (no OpenAI API initially)
- **Scope:** Self-contained module only, no integration yet
- **Quality:** 60-70% accuracy acceptable for MVP

**Key takeaway:** Boundaries that prevent scope creep.

#### **`decisions-made.md`**
- **10 FIRM decisions:** Python/FastAPI, spaCy, Docker, mock-first, REST API, etc.
- **Rationale for each:** Why we chose what we chose
- **Alternatives considered:** What we rejected and why

**Key takeaway:** Technology choices are decided with clear reasoning.

## 📝 Full Discovery Report (`guides/AI-MODULE-DISCOVERY-REPORT.md`)

This is the **eventual vision** (not the 2-week MVP):
- All 26 technology components
- Complete architecture with all integrations
- Multi-model strategy (GPT-4, Claude, spaCy)
- Production monitoring, scaling, resilience
- Accuracy targets up to 95%

**Use this for:** Understanding the long-term plan (Phase 2-5)
**Don't use this for:** Your 2-week MVP (use the MVP plan instead)

---

## ✅ What's Already Decided (FIRM Decisions)

These technology choices are **locked in** for MVP:

| Component | Technology | Why |
|-----------|------------|-----|
| Language | Python 3.11 | Best AI/ML ecosystem |
| API Framework | FastAPI | Async, modern, auto-docs |
| Local NER | spaCy | Free, fast, good enough for MVP |
| Container | Docker | Isolated, reproducible deployment |
| Validation | Pydantic | Request/response schemas |
| Server | uvicorn | ASGI server for FastAPI |
| Testing | pytest | Standard Python testing |

**What's NOT in MVP:** OpenAI API, Vector DB, Graph DB, Redis, RabbitMQ, Prometheus

---

## ❓ What's Still Open (Need Research)

These questions need answers **after** MVP:

1. **Vector Database:** Pinecone vs. Qdrant vs. Weaviate vs. pgvector? (CRITICAL PATH for Phase 2)
2. **Prompt Framework:** LangChain vs. Semantic Kernel vs. Custom?
3. **Self-Hosted LLM:** Llama 3 vs. Mistral? (Phase 5, potential $50k/year savings)
4. **Graph Query Optimization:** Index strategy, caching approach?
5. **Entity Resolution:** Algorithm choice, threshold tuning?

**Don't solve these now.** Build the MVP first.

---

## 🚧 What NOT to Build (Out of MVP Scope)

These are **explicitly deferred** to post-MVP:

- ❌ OpenAI/Claude integration (costs money, use free spaCy)
- ❌ Vector databases (not needed for basic extraction)
- ❌ Graph databases (document requirements, don't build)
- ❌ Redis caching (premature optimization)
- ❌ RabbitMQ events (standalone module first)
- ❌ Multi-model selection (just spaCy for MVP)
- ❌ Relationship extraction (entities only for MVP)
- ❌ News report generation (too complex for MVP)
- ❌ Production monitoring (basic logging sufficient)

**Why this matters:** Keeps MVP under 80 hours.

## ✅ Ready to Build?

**You are ready to start MVP implementation when you:**
- ✅ Understand the 7 MVP components (not 26!)
- ✅ Know it's ONE developer, TWO weeks, 60-70% accuracy target
- ✅ Understand it's self-contained (no databases, no integrations yet)
- ✅ Have Docker installed and working

**Next steps:**
1. Read `guides/AI-MODULE-2-WEEK-MVP.md` (your day-by-day plan)
2. Set up Python 3.11 + virtual environment
3. Create project structure
4. Start Day 1: FastAPI skeleton + Docker setup

## 📞 Common Questions

**"Should I use OpenAI API?"**
No, use free spaCy for MVP. OpenAI is Phase 2.

**"Do I need a vector database?"**
No, out of MVP scope. Document the requirement for Phase 2.

**"What accuracy should I target?"**
60-70% is acceptable for MVP. 95% is eventual Phase 5 goal.

**"How many components?"**
7 for MVP. The other 19 are documented but not built.

**"Can I finish in 2 weeks?"**
Yes, if you follow the MVP plan and don't add scope.
