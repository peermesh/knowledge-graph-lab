## Success Definition

Phase 5 succeeds when Knowledge Graph Lab operates as a unified system that:
- **Discovers** opportunities through automated content monitoring
- **Understands** content through AI-powered entity and relationship extraction
- **Reasons** about patterns and connections in the knowledge graph
- **Delivers** personalized insights through multiple distribution channels

The integrated system should demonstrate clear value that exceeds the sum of its individual modules.
