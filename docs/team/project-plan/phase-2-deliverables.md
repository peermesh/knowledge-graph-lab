# Phase 2 Deliverables

Planning & Design Phase

---

## Objectives

Create comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) that will:
- Define exactly what each module will build
- Ensure SpecKit compatibility for automated code generation
- Establish clear API contracts between modules
- Document all integration points
- Provide complete specifications for Phase 3 development

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Product Requirements Document (10-15 pages)

Your PRD MUST follow the SpecKit-compatible format from [../../speckit-guide.md](../../speckit-guide.md):

#### Required Sections:
1. **System Overview** - Purpose, users, integration points
2. **Functional Requirements** - What each feature does
3. **Data Models** - Entities with specific field types
4. **API Specifications** - Endpoints with request/response schemas
5. **UI Specifications** - User interface requirements (Frontend only)
6. **Integration Requirements** - How modules connect
7. **Acceptance Criteria** - Testable success conditions
8. **Technical Constraints** - Performance, security, scalability

#### Key Requirements:
- **Be specific about types**: `string(255)` not just "text"
- **Include all schemas**: Complete JSON examples
- **Define all states**: Loading, error, success, empty
- **Mark uncertainties**: `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: question]`

### 2. Integration Contracts

Document how your module connects with others:
- **Shared data formats** - Exact schemas
- **API endpoints** - Your module provides/consumes
- **Events** - Published/subscribed events
- **Dependencies** - What you need from other modules

### 3. Technical Decisions

Document key choices from your Phase 1 research:
- **Technology stack** - Languages, frameworks, libraries
- **Database design** - Schema, indexes, relationships
- **Architecture patterns** - Design patterns to follow
- **Security approach** - Authentication, authorization, encryption

## SpecKit Preparation

Your PRD must be ready for code generation:

### Validation Checklist:
- [ ] All 8 required sections complete
- [ ] Data types specified for every field
- [ ] API schemas include examples
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable
- [ ] Integration points documented
- [ ] No placeholder text or TODOs

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- ❌ Vague types: "number" → ✅ "integer, range 1-100"
- ❌ Missing schemas: "user data" → ✅ Complete JSON schema
- ❌ Unclear states: "handle errors" → ✅ "Show 'Connection failed' message"
- ❌ Incomplete APIs: "CRUD operations" → ✅ All 4 endpoints specified

---

## Module-Specific Requirements

### Backend Architecture
Focus on:
- Complete API specifications (all endpoints)
- Database schema with relationships
- Authentication/authorization rules
- Background job definitions
- Caching strategies

### Frontend Design
Focus on:
- Page layouts and navigation flows
- Component hierarchy and props
- Form validations and error states
- Real-time update requirements
- Responsive design breakpoints

### AI Development
Focus on:
- Input/output data formats
- Processing pipeline stages
- Model integration specifications
- Accuracy/performance targets
- Fallback behaviors

### Publishing Tools
Focus on:
- Content format transformations
- Distribution channel APIs
- Template specifications
- Scheduling requirements
- Analytics tracking

## Submission Process

1. **Write** your PRD following the SpecKit structure
2. **Validate** using the checklist in [speckit-guide.md](../../speckit-guide.md)
3. **Save** to `/docs/team/module-assignments/[your-module]/deliverables/phase-2-planning/PRD.md`
4. **Submit** via pull request - See [Git Workflow](../../git-workflow.md)
5. **Notify** in Discord when complete

---

## Success Criteria

Your Phase 2 is complete when:

✅ **PRD is SpecKit-ready**
- All required sections present
- Types and schemas specified
- Ready for code generation

✅ **Integration defined**
- API contracts documented
- Shared data formats agreed
- Dependencies identified

✅ **Decisions documented**
- Technology choices explained
- Architecture patterns selected
- Trade-offs acknowledged

✅ **Quality verified**
- Peer reviewed by team
- No missing information
- Uncertainties clearly marked

---

## Timeline

- **Start**: After Phase 1 research approval
- **Duration**: Flexible based on completeness
- **Review**: Team lead reviews before Phase 3
- **Gate**: PRD must pass SpecKit validation

---

## Resources

### Essential Guides
- **SpecKit Guide**: [../../speckit-guide.md](../../speckit-guide.md) - MUST READ
- **Git Workflow**: [../../git-workflow.md](../../git-workflow.md)
- **Phase 2 Quick Start**: [../../PHASE-2-QUICK-START.md](../../PHASE-2-QUICK-START.md)

### Examples
- **Publishing PRD Example**: `../module-assignments/publishing-tools/deliverables/phase-2-planning/examples/PRD-example.md`

### Your Phase 1 Research
- Use your research to inform technical decisions
- Reference findings in your PRD
- Justify choices based on research

## Common Questions

**Q: How detailed should my PRD be?**
A: Detailed enough that SpecKit can generate working code. Every data field needs a type, every API needs schemas.

**Q: What if I'm unsure about something?**
A: Mark it with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: your question]` and continue. Don't leave sections blank.

**Q: Can I include diagrams?**
A: Yes! Architecture diagrams, flowcharts, and mockups are helpful. Use Mermaid or ASCII art.

**Q: What if my module doesn't have a UI?**
A: Skip the UI Specifications section and note "Not applicable - backend service only"

**Q: How do I coordinate integration points?**
A: Discuss in #kgl-integration channel. Document agreements in your PRD.

## Next Phase

After Phase 2 approval, Phase 3 will:
1. Run SpecKit on your PRD to generate initial code
2. Use AI agents to refine and complete the implementation
3. Build your MVP based on these specifications

Your PRD quality directly determines Phase 3 success!
