# Phase 3 Deliverables

MVP Development Phase

---

## Objectives

Build a working minimal viable product for your module that:

- Runs independently in Docker containers
- Implements all core functionality
- Operates without dependencies on other team members' code
- Demonstrates the key value proposition of your module
- Provides a foundation for Phase 4 enhancements

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Working Standalone Module
- **Complete Docker setup** - Container starts without errors in under 30 seconds
- **Core functionality implemented** - All essential features working end-to-end
- **Independent operation** - Runs without requiring other modules
- **Data persistence** - Proper database/storage integration
- **Basic API endpoints** - REST endpoints for core operations

### 2. Technical Documentation
- **Setup instructions** - Complete README with installation steps
- **API documentation** - Endpoint specifications with examples
- **Architecture overview** - How your module works internally
- **Testing guide** - How to verify functionality
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

### 3. Performance Validation
- **Response time targets** - All CRUD operations under 500ms for typical payloads
- **Throughput demonstration** - Handle specified concurrent users (varies by module)
- **Resource usage** - Memory and CPU utilization within reasonable bounds
- **Error handling** - Graceful degradation and recovery

---

## Module-Specific Requirements

### Backend Architecture
Focus on:

- Complete REST API with all planned endpoints
- Database operations (CRUD) for all entities
- JWT authentication system functional
- Basic monitoring and logging
- Docker container with database connectivity

### Frontend Design
Focus on:

- All core user interface components
- Navigation between major sections
- Form handling and validation
- API integration with mock or real backends
- Responsive design implementation

### AI Development
Focus on:

- Entity extraction pipeline working end-to-end
- LLM integration with chosen providers
- Basic knowledge graph construction
- Processing pipeline handling real documents
- Confidence scoring system

### Publishing Tools
Focus on:

- Content ingestion and transformation
- Multi-channel publishing capability
- Template system for content formatting
- Basic personalization features
- Analytics and tracking implementation

---

## Success Criteria

Your Phase 3 is complete when:

✅ **Docker deployment works**

- Container starts reliably without manual intervention
- All services initialize properly
- Database connections establish successfully

✅ **Core functionality demonstrates value**

- Primary use case works end-to-end
- Users can accomplish the main task your module enables
- Data flows correctly through your system

✅ **Performance meets targets**

- Response times within specified bounds
- Handles expected concurrent load
- Resource usage is reasonable

✅ **Documentation enables others**

- Another developer can set up and run your module
- API endpoints are clearly documented
- Architecture decisions are explained

---

## Submission Process

1. **Organize your work** in the appropriate deliverables directory
2. **Include all required files**:
   - `README.md` with setup instructions
   - `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml`
   - Source code with clear structure
   - API documentation
   - Any necessary configuration files
3. **Test your setup** on a clean machine/environment
4. **Submit via pull request** - Follow [Git Workflow Guide](../git-workflow.md)
5. **Demo functionality** at Phase 4 kickoff meeting

### File Organization
```
docs/team/module-assignments/[your-module]/deliverables/phase-3-mvp/
├── README.md (setup and usage instructions)
├── ARCHITECTURE.md (technical overview)
├── API.md (endpoint documentation)
└── [source-code-location] (link or instructions to find code)
```

> **Note**: Actual source code may be located outside the docs/ directory. Document the location clearly in your README.md.

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Over-engineering** - Focus on core functionality, not edge cases

❌ **Missing Docker setup** - Container must start reliably

❌ **No error handling** - Plan for failures and network issues

❌ **Incomplete documentation** - Others must be able to run your code

❌ **Dependency on other modules** - Your module must work independently

---

## Timeline

- **Start**: After Phase 2 PRD approval
- **Duration**: Flexible based on module complexity
- **Checkpoint**: Mid-phase sync for blocker resolution
- **Demo**: Phase 4 kickoff meeting
- **Gate**: All success criteria must be met before Phase 4

---

## Resources

### Essential References
- **Docker Guide**: Containerization best practices
- **Git Workflow**: [../git-workflow.md](../git-workflow.md)
- **Your Phase 2 PRD**: Use as implementation specification
- **Module Specifications**: Technical requirements in [../../modules/](../../modules/)

### Getting Help
- **Technical Issues**: Post in your module's Discord channel
- **Integration Questions**: Discuss in #kgl-integration
- **Process Questions**: Check with team lead
- **Docker Problems**: Share container logs for debugging

---

## Next Phase

After Phase 3 approval, Phase 4 will:

1. **Enhance your MVP** with additional features and polish
2. **Optimize performance** based on real usage patterns
3. **Prepare for demo** with presentation-ready functionality
4. **Refine user experience** based on testing and feedback

Your MVP quality directly determines Phase 4 enhancement possibilities!
