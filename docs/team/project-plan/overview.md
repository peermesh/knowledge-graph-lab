# Project Plan

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Name | Key Deliverable |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Research | Research briefs with technology recommendations |
| 2 | Planning | Technical design docs and project plan |
| 3 | MVP | Working prototype with core features |
| 4 | Enhancement | Polished system with full features |
| 5 | Integration | Production-ready integrated system |

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Research
**Start**: When project begins

**Tasks**:
- You'll research specific technologies: Neo4j vs ArangoDB for graph database
- You'll understand the creator economy problem: How do creators find opportunities?
- You'll explore 3 solution approaches: Manual curation, AI discovery, hybrid system
- You'll create 5-page research brief with pros/cons table

**Deliverables**:
- Research brief with technology recommendations
- Problem analysis
- Proposed solutions with justification
- Key findings and insights

**Success Criteria**:
- Research brief contains exactly 3 technology options per decision with detailed comparison table
- Each recommendation includes specific quantified pros/cons analysis (measurable performance metrics, concrete cost analysis with numbers)
- All choices backed by verifiable evidence (published benchmarks with specific performance numbers, documented case studies with measurable outcomes, official documentation links)

**Team Sync**: Present research findings at Phase 2 kickoff

---

### Phase 2: Planning
**Start**: When Phase 1 completes

**Tasks**:
- You'll create 10-page PRD for your module with technical specifications
- You'll define module scope and REST API endpoints with example requests/responses
- You'll make specific technology decisions: FastAPI vs Flask, PostgreSQL vs MongoDB
- You'll document dependencies and interfaces with integration diagrams
- You'll participate in 3 planning discussions with feedback sessions

**Deliverables**:
- Individual Module PRD with specifications
- API definitions
- Technology stack for your module
- Development approach
- Success criteria

**Team Sync**: Share PRD and get feedback at Phase 3 kickoff

---

### Phase 3: MVP Development
**Start**: When Phase 2 completes

**Tasks**:
- You'll set up environment and configuration (beginning of phase)
- You'll create Docker container for your standalone module
- You'll install development tools
- You'll run basic tests to verify setup
- You'll build minimal viable product
- You'll implement core functionality
- You'll ensure module runs independently in Docker

**Deliverables**:
- Working standalone module in Docker
- All core features implemented
- Documentation/README
- Module runs independently without other team members' code

**Success Criteria**:
- Docker container starts without errors in under 30 seconds on standard hardware
- All CREATE/READ/UPDATE/DELETE operations complete in under 500ms for typical payloads
- Module successfully ingests data from exactly 10 different RSS feeds with 99% uptime success rate over 24-hour test period

**Team Sync**: Demo MVP at Phase 4 kickoff

---

### Phase 4: Enhancement
**Start**: When Phase 3 completes

**Tasks**:
- You'll add feature improvements to standalone module
- You'll optimize performance
- You'll polish and refine user experience
- You'll extend functionality
- You'll prepare for demo presentation

**Deliverables**:
- Enhanced standalone module with extended features
- Performance improvements implemented
- Polished user experience
- Updated documentation
- Demo-ready presentation

**Team Sync**: Full presentation at Demo Day

---

### Demo Day
**Timing**: When Phase 4 completes

**Format**:
- Zoom call with screen sharing
- Each person presents their standalone module
- Show MVP with enhancements
- Q&A about each module
- Review what everyone built independently

---

### Phase 5: Integration
**Start**: After Demo Day

**Tasks**:
- You'll plan integration based on demo learnings
- You'll merge individual modules together
- You'll implement cross-module integration
- You'll create unified API or integration layer
- You'll conduct end-to-end testing
- You'll assemble final system

**Deliverables**:
- Integration-ready modules
- Documented API endpoints
- Integration tests passing
- Unified production system

**Success Criteria**:
- Load test passes with exactly 100 concurrent users sustained for 10 minutes without failures
- Integrated system maintains 99.9% uptime during continuous 72-hour test period
- 95th percentile response time stays under 1 second for all API endpoints during peak load

**Team Sync**: Show integrated system at final review

---

## Phase Rhythm

### Phase Start
- Kickoff meeting
- Review previous progress
- Set priorities for phase

### Mid-Phase
- Sync meeting
- Resolve blockers
- Check progress

### Phase End
- Deliverable due
- Phase wrap-up
- Preview next phase

---

## Communication Schedule

### Daily
- Async updates in team channel
- Report blockers immediately

### Per Phase
- Phase kickoff meeting
- Mid-phase sync
- Phase review and handoff

---

## Key Requirements

### Docker Requirements (Phase 3+)
- All modules must run in Docker containers starting Phase 3
- Each container must be fully self-contained
- Container startup time under 30 seconds
- All dependencies included in container image

### Module Independence (Through Phase 4)
- Each module works without dependencies on other team members' code
- No shared databases or services until Phase 5
- Complete functionality demonstrable in isolation
- API endpoints fully functional for standalone testing

---

## Dependencies

### Phase Dependencies
- Phase 2 requires completed Phase 1 research
- Phase 3 requires approved Phase 2 designs
- Phase 4 builds on Phase 3 MVP
- Phase 5 requires all Phase 4 modules complete

### No Inter-Module Dependencies
You develop modules independently through Phase 4. You integrate them only in Phase 5.
