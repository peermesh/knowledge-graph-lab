# Team Start Here

Welcome! You're here to build a module. Let's get you to the right place.

## System Architecture

*The Knowledge Graph Lab consists of interconnected modules that work together through a central Core Module. Each team member will be building one of these specialized modules.*

## Module Assignment Table

| Your Role | Your Module Directory | Assignment File | Example Focus |

## Development Roadmap

![Knowledge Graph Lab Roadmap](../images/Knowledge-Graph-Lab-roadmap.png)

*This roadmap shows the 5-phase development process you'll follow: from initial research through to final integration. Each phase builds upon the previous one, culminating in a connected, publicly available system.*

## Your Next Steps

1. **Review the project plan**: [project-plan/overview.md](project-plan/overview.md) - Understand all phases
2. **Check phase deliverables**: [project-plan/phase-1-deliverables.md](project-plan/phase-1-deliverables.md) - Phase 1 requirements
3. **Navigate to your module**: Go to your assigned module directory from the table above
4. **Complete your assigned work**: Follow the guidance in your module's assignment files

## Module Work Structure

Each module directory contains:
- `01-work-description.md` - Your module's complete scope
- `02-phase-1-research/` - Phase 1 research documents
  - `02a-phase-1-research-overview.md` - Phase 1 research context
  - `02b-phase-1-research-assignment.md` - Phase 1 specific tasks
  - `02c-phase-1-research-advanced.md` - Additional resources
- `03-phase-2-prd+plan/` - Phase 2 PRD and implementation documents
  - `03a-phase-2-prd-overview.md` - Phase 2 PRD context
  - `03b-phase-2-prd-assignment.md` - Phase 2 specific tasks
  - `03c-phase-2-prd-advanced.md` - Advanced implementation guidance
