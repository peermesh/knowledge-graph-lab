# RequirementsKit Quickstart Guide

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-09
**Purpose**: Entry point for anyone using RequirementsKit to develop comprehensive requirements for module PRDs

---

## What Is This?

**RequirementsKit** is a systematic requirements engineering system for creating comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) that SpecKit (the `/specify` command) can transform into implementation-ready specifications.

**The Problem It Solves**: SpecKit's `/specify` command needs rich, detailed requirements to produce quality output. Without comprehensive source material, SpecKit produces generic 126-line specs with gaps. RequirementsKit ensures you develop that comprehensive requirements documentation.

**The Result**: 500-1000 line comprehensive requirements documentation that SpecKit transforms into implementation-ready specifications with all details intact.

---

## How to Read This Documentation

RequirementsKit documentation is organized into three levels:

**Level 1: Navigation (YOU ARE HERE)**
- **[quickstart.md](quickstart.md)**: This file - entry point, directory structure, quick reference

**Level 2: Methodology (HOW to create input)**
- **[methodology.md](methodology.md)**: Complete guide with examples, day-by-day execution, common pitfalls

**Level 3: Process (WHAT the workflow is)**
- **[workflow.md](workflow.md)**: Official terminology, work orders, formal process definition

**Recommended reading order**:
1. Skim this quickstart to understand structure
2. Read methodology.md for detailed HOW
3. Reference workflow.md for official WHAT

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Understand the System (15 minutes)

Read these in order:
1. **[quickstart.md](quickstart.md)** - Navigation and setup (YOU ARE HERE)
2. **[methodology.md](methodology.md)** - HOW to create SpecKit input (detailed guide)
3. **[workflow.md](workflow.md)** - WHAT the official process is (formal definition)

**Want to see real examples?**
- Review the Project Tracking SQLite case study referenced in methodology.md (576-line implementation)
- See the Publishing Tools example in workflow.md (625-line comprehensive spec)

### 2. Set Up Your Module Workspace (10 minutes)

Create a workspace directory for your module:

```bash
# Create your module directory
mkdir -p work/{your-module-name}

# You'll create files following the sequence in workflow.md
```

**What you'll create** (see workflow.md for complete file sequence):
- `00-{module}-decisions.md` - Document MVP scope and decisions (WO-1)
- `01-INFORMATION-SOURCES-INDEX.md` - Index all source documents (WO-2)
- `05-COMPREHENSIVE-SPEC.md` - Detailed PRD (WO-3)
- `10-FINAL-SPEC.md` - Refined specification (WO-4)
- `11-IMPLEMENTATION-READINESS.md` - Validation and GO/NO-GO (WO-5)
- Additional files as needed for gaps, assumptions, and session tracking

### 3. Follow the 5-Phase Process

For complete process flow with work orders and dependencies, see **[workflow.md](workflow.md)**.

**Quick summary**:
1. Setup workspace (10 min)
2. Information gathering (4-6 hours)
3. Spec creation (6-10 hours) - see **[methodology.md](methodology.md)** for details
4. SpecKit processing (2-4 hours)
5. Validation (2-3 hours)

**Total per module**: 14-23 hours

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

**For detailed pitfalls and how to avoid them, see [methodology.md](methodology.md#common-pitfalls).**

**Quick summary**:
1. **Scope Creep**: Creating 10-phase project instead of 2-4 week MVP
2. **Missing Standalone**: Module depends on other modules not ready
3. **Sparse Input**: 200-line input produces generic spec
4. **Lost Context**: Can't remember decisions between sessions
5. **Unclear Sources**: Don't know what docs were used

**Solutions**: All detailed in methodology guide

---

## 🎓 Learning Path

### Beginner (First Module)
1. Read [methodology.md](methodology.md) and [workflow.md](workflow.md)
2. Review case study to see end-to-end example
3. Follow process step-by-step
4. Use checklists heavily

### Intermediate (Second+ Module)
1. Skim methodology and workflow to refresh
2. Apply lessons from first module
3. Identify patterns and improvements

3. **Update changelog**: Date, change, reason
4. **Notify team**: If significant change
5. **Update changelog**: Document changes in [reference/changelog.md](../reference/changelog.md)

### Where to Document Feedback

**Good feedback**:
→ Update relevant meta-instruction document

**Process improvements**:
→ Update [workflow.md](workflow.md) or [methodology.md](methodology.md)

**Template refinements**:
→ Update [comprehensive-template.md](../templates/comprehensive-template.md)
