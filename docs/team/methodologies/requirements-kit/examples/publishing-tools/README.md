# Publishing Module Case Study

**Module:** Publishing Tools for PeerMesh
**Status:** Complete - Implementation Ready
**Complexity:** Medium-High (625 lines final PRD)
**Created:** 2025-10-09

> **Note:** This is a complete working example showing RequirementsKit applied to a real module.
> Use this to understand what a finished PRD looks like and how to scope an MVP effectively.

## Example Purpose

This example demonstrates RequirementsKit applied to a **medium-high complexity module** with multiple integrations, external tools, and complex workflows.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Final PRD Size:** 625 lines (compared to project-tracking-sqlite: 576 lines)
- **Complexity Level:** Medium-High (multiple external APIs, CLI tools, schema design)
- **Integration Points:** 8 (Obsidian API, filesystem, SQLite, CLI, markdown, YAML)
- **Development Phases:** 5 work orders (WO-1 through WO-5)
- **Validation Result:** 100% PASS with GO recommendation (95% confidence)

---

## What This Example Demonstrates

### 1. Complete 5-Phase Workflow
This example shows the full RequirementsKit workflow from initial requirements through final validation:

1. **Phase 1:** MVP scope definition and decisions
2. **Phase 2:** Information gathering and gap identification
3. **Phase 3:** Comprehensive specification development
4. **Phase 4:** Dual-output distillation (comprehensive + starter)
5. **Phase 5:** Implementation readiness assessment

### 2. Complex Module Handling
Unlike simpler modules, Publishing demonstrates:
- **Multiple Tool Integration:** Obsidian API, CLI tools, filesystem operations
- **Schema Design:** Publishing metadata, relationship tracking
- **External Dependencies:** npm packages, filesystem watchers
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive edge case coverage
- **User Workflows:** Multi-step publishing processes

### 3. Real-World Process Documentation
The session log captures actual development decisions, including:
- MVP scope trade-offs (what to include/exclude)
- Technical architecture choices
- Integration pattern decisions
- Quality validation steps
- Process improvements discovered during execution

## Comparison with Project-Tracking-SQLite

| Aspect | Project-Tracking-SQLite | Publishing Module |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Complexity** | Medium | Medium-High |
| **Final PRD Size** | 576 lines | 625 lines |
| **Integration Points** | 3 (SQLite, filesystem, CLI) | 8 (Obsidian, SQLite, filesystem, CLI, markdown, YAML, npm, watchers) |
| **External APIs** | None | Obsidian Plugin API |
| **Schema Complexity** | Low (task tracking) | Medium (publishing metadata, relationships) |
| **Best For Learning** | Simple workflow, basic integration | Complex workflows, multiple integrations |

## When to Reference This Case Study

### Use Publishing Module as Reference When:
- Building modules with **multiple external tool integrations**
- Designing **complex schemas** with relationships
- Working with **external APIs** (REST, plugin systems)
- Implementing **multi-step user workflows**
- Handling **file system operations** with watching/monitoring
- Creating **CLI tools** with multiple commands

### Use Project-Tracking-SQLite as Reference When:
- Building **simpler, focused modules**
- Learning the **basic workflow** first
- Working with **single-database** integrations
- Creating **straightforward CRUD operations**
- Starting with Pre-SpecKit for the first time

## Key Learnings from Publishing Module

### Successes (What Worked)
1. **Two-template system:** 500-line starter effectively compressed to 625-line final PRD
2. **Work order structure:** Clear phase separation prevented scope creep
3. **MVP decisions template:** Forced early trade-off discussions
4. **Validation framework:** Caught quality issues before implementation
5. **Gap documentation:** All issues captured for future improvement

### Gaps Identified (Fixed in Phase 1)
1. `/specify` command usage unclear (30 min confusion)
2. Length guidance missing (45 min wasted)
3. Quality comparison checklist missing (1 hour wasted)
4. Validation checklist template missing (1 hour wasted)
5. Work order dependency diagram missing (30 min confusion)
6. Session log template missing (20 min setup)
7. Numbered file example missing (15 min confusion)
8. Technical validation layer missing (8 issues in Publishing PRD)

**Total Time Lost:** 3-6 hours
**Solution:** All gaps have documented fixes (see `12-LEARNINGS` file)
