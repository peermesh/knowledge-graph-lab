# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Publishing Tools Module

**Module Name**: Publishing Tools
**Version**: 1.0 (MVP)
**Owner(s)**: Publishing Module Team
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Implementation Ready

---

**Purpose**: This document defines requirements for the Publishing Tools module, enabling automated email delivery of curated content to users based on their interests.

**Why this matters**: The Publishing module connects AI-generated content to user engagement, delivering personalized digests while building the knowledge graph feedback loop.

**Scope**: MVP focuses on email-only publishing with 5 core features, 2-4 week implementation timeline.

---

## Section 1: Problem Statement

### Current Situation

Users interested in curated content discovery face significant challenges:

**No Automated Content Delivery**: Users must manually visit the platform daily to check for new articles matching their interests. Research shows 70% of content goes undiscovered when delivery is pull-based rather than push-based.

**Time Waste on Manual Research**: Content creators and researchers spend an average of 30 minutes per day manually searching for relevant articles across multiple sources. This time could be better spent on core work—content creation, analysis, or strategic thinking.

**Inconsistent Content Discovery**: Without automated, interest-based filtering, users either miss relevant content entirely or face information overload. The platform's AI module generates high-quality, curated articles, but their value is diminished when discovery is left to chance.

**No User-Specific Content Channels**: Current system lacks personalized delivery mechanisms. Users cannot subscribe to topics of interest and receive regular updates, preventing the platform from building a sustainable engagement loop.

**Missing Feedback Mechanism**: Without a publishing system, there's no way to track which content resonates with users (clicks, engagement), limiting the AI module's ability to improve content relevance over time.

### Who is Affected

**Primary Users: Content Creators and Researchers**
- 50-100 expected users in MVP phase (verified email addresses in AWS SES Sandbox)
- Environment: Desktop and mobile email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)
- Use case: Weekly digest of 3-5 articles matching their interests
- Time saved: 30 minutes per week of manual research
- Engagement expectation: Read 2-3 articles per digest, click-through to full content

**Secondary Users: Platform Administrators**
- Environment: Server infrastructure (Docker containers)
- Use case: Monitor email delivery, track engagement, manage subscriptions
- Scale expectation: Handle 100-500 emails per week during MVP
- Operational requirement: Manual database queries for analytics (no dashboard in MVP)

**System Components Affected**
- AI Module: Provides articles, needs feedback on user engagement
- Backend Module: Stores user preferences, triggers publication events
- Frontend Module: Collects user preferences, displays unsubscribe confirmations
- AWS SES: Email delivery infrastructure (Sandbox mode initially, then production)

### Scale Expectations

**MVP Scale (Weeks 1-4)**:
- Users: 50-100 test users
- Email volume: 100-500 emails per week (weekly digests)
- Articles per email: 3-5 articles
- Database records: ~1,000 dispatch logs, ~500 article records
- Storage: Minimal (<100MB for logs and templates)

**Post-MVP Growth (Months 2-6)**:
- Users: 1,000-10,000 active subscribers
- Email volume: 10,000-50,000 emails per week
- Database records: ~100,000 dispatch logs, ~10,000 articles
- Storage: ~1-5GB (90-day retention for logs)
- Rate limiting: Stay within AWS SES quotas (14 emails/sec production limit)

### Goals

**User-Facing Goals**:
1. **Save User Time**: Reduce manual research time by 30 minutes per week per user (90% reduction from 35 minutes to 5 minutes)
2. **Increase Content Discovery**: Deliver 3-5 relevant articles per digest with 60%+ click-through rate
3. **Legal Compliance**: Provide one-click unsubscribe in all emails (CAN-SPAM Act compliant)
4. **Consistent Delivery**: 99%+ successful email delivery rate (emails reach inbox, not spam)

**Technical Goals**:
1. **Reliable Automation**: Automated weekly digests with zero manual intervention
2. **Integration Success**: Seamless integration with AI, Backend, and Frontend modules via documented APIs
3. **Standalone Operation**: Module operates independently using mock data for all dependencies
4. **Fast Response**: Email assembly and dispatch complete within 30 seconds per user

**Business Goals**:
1. **Prove Publishing Model**: Validate email publishing as core engagement channel
2. **Build Feedback Loop**: Track which articles users engage with to improve AI content generation
3. **Scale Foundation**: Architecture supports 10x growth post-MVP without rewrite
4. **Minimize Cost**: Operate within AWS SES free tier during MVP (62,000 emails/month)

### Measurable Outcomes

- **Time Savings**: Users report 30 minutes per week saved on manual research (user survey metric)
- **Engagement Rate**: 60% of users click at least one article per digest (click tracking)
- **Delivery Success**: 99% of emails delivered successfully (SES delivery logs)
- **Unsubscribe Rate**: <5% unsubscribe rate after 4 weeks (low churn)
- **System Uptime**: 99.9% uptime for email dispatch service (monitoring metrics)
- **Response Time**: 95th percentile email assembly time <30 seconds (performance logs)

## Section 2: User Stories

### US-1: Weekly Email Digest Subscription

As a content creator interested in AI and open source topics,
I need to receive a weekly email digest of 3-5 relevant articles,
So that I save 30 minutes per week of manual research and stay informed.

**Acceptance**: User receives exactly one email per week on scheduled day within 10 minutes of scheduled time, containing 3-5 articles matching user's tags, with zero duplicate articles across consecutive digests.

### US-2: Article Selection from AI Module

As a user with specific interests (e.g., "creator economy", "web3"),
I need the system to automatically select articles matching my tags,
So that every email I receive is relevant and worth my time.

**Acceptance**: System queries AI module with user's tags, excludes previously sent articles, returns 3-5 matching articles in <5 seconds per user.

### US-3: Email Template Rendering

As a user receiving a weekly digest,
I need the email to be professionally formatted and readable across all email clients,
So that I can easily read article summaries and click through to full content.

**Acceptance**: Email renders correctly in Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail (90% of users), includes headline, summary (~200 words), and "Read More" link for each article, loads in <3 seconds.

### US-4: One-Click Unsubscribe

As a user who no longer wants to receive digests,
I need to click one unsubscribe link and confirm my cancellation,
So that I stop receiving emails immediately without hassle.

**Acceptance**: Unsubscribe link in every email, clicking takes user to confirmation page within 2 seconds, user sees subscription details, after confirmation receives zero future emails (verified within 1 week), completes in ≤3 clicks total.

### US-5: Email Dispatch via SES

As a system administrator,
I need the system to dispatch emails via AWS SES with delivery tracking,
So that I can monitor delivery success and troubleshoot failures.

**Acceptance**: System sends via AWS SES SendEmail API, logs SES message ID for every attempt, handles errors gracefully (retry transient, log permanent), respects SES rate limits (0.5 emails/sec Sandbox, 7 emails/sec production), 99% successfully handed off to SES.

### US-6: Article Deduplication

As a user receiving multiple weekly digests,
I need each digest to contain only new articles I haven't seen before,
So that I'm not wasting time re-reading content.

**Acceptance**: System tracks all article IDs sent to each user, excludes previously sent articles from queries to AI module, zero duplicate articles across any two digests for same user (verified over 4 weeks).

### US-7: Dispatch Logging

As a system administrator troubleshooting email delivery,
I need complete logs of every dispatch attempt with timestamps and outcomes,
So that I can diagnose failures and track delivery success rates.

**Acceptance**: Every dispatch attempt logged to database with user_id, message_id, timestamp, status (sent/failed/bounced), logs retained for 90 days then auto-purged, 100% of dispatch attempts logged.

## Section 4: Acceptance Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Weekly Digest Successful Delivery

**Given** user with email "alice@example.com" has active subscription with topics ["AI", "technology"], frequency "weekly", next scheduled send "2025-09-24T09:00:00Z", and has previously received articles ["report-100", "report-101"]

**When** publishing module polls for pending requests at 2025-09-24T09:05:00Z

**Then** system fetches request, queries AI module excluding previously sent articles, returns 5 new articles, renders email template, dispatches via SES successfully (HTTP 200, message_id received), creates dispatch log with status "sent" and article_ids array, updates request state to "published", updates next_scheduled_send to next week, user receives email in inbox within 60 seconds, total processing time <30 seconds

**Measurement**: 99% delivery success rate, <30 second processing time at 95th percentile

### Scenario 2: Unsubscribe Flow Completion

**Given** user "bob@example.com" with active subscription to topics ["creator economy", "open source"], receives weekly digest with unsubscribe link containing HMAC-signed token (payload: user_id, email, timestamp), token valid (timestamp within 30 days)

**When** user clicks unsubscribe link and confirms

**Then** system verifies token signature and timestamp, serves confirmation page showing email and subscription details, processes confirmation, updates user record (active=false, unsubscribed_at=NOW()), returns success response, shows "successfully unsubscribed" page, user receives zero future emails (verified over 7 days), Backend skips creating future requests for inactive users

**Measurement**: Unsubscribe completes in ≤3 clicks, 100% effective (zero emails after confirmation)

### Scenario 3: Email Dispatch Failure and Retry

**Given** publication request "req-003" for user "carol@example.com" is pending, AWS SES quota limit reached (daily send limit exceeded), current retry attempt count is 0

**When** publishing module attempts dispatch

**Then** system renders email successfully, calls AWS SES SendEmail API, receives LimitExceededException error, creates dispatch log with status "failed" and error message, keeps request state as "pending" (not "published"), retries with exponential backoff (wait 1s, retry; wait 2s, retry; wait 4s, retry), after 3 failed attempts marks request as "failed" and logs error, alerts administrator via monitoring system, request retried on next polling cycle (5 minutes later)

**Measurement**: Total retry window 7 seconds (1s + 2s + 4s), error logged for admin review

### Scenario 4: Article Deduplication Across Weeks

**Given** user "dave@example.com" subscribed to tags ["web3", "blockchain"], Week 1 digest sent with articles ["article-A", "article-B", "article-C", "article-D", "article-E"], sent_articles_history contains 5 records for user-004, Week 2 scheduled send is 2025-09-24T09:00:00Z, AI module has 8 matching articles including duplicates

**When** publishing module selects Week 2 articles

**Then** system queries sent_articles_history for user-004, builds exclude_ids list with 5 previous articles, queries AI module with tags and exclude_ids, AI module filters and returns 5 new articles ["article-F", "article-G", "article-H", "article-I", "article-J"], Week 2 email contains only new articles with zero overlap from Week 1, sent_articles_history updated with 5 new records (total 10 for user-004), deduplication query executes in <2 seconds

**Measurement**: Zero duplicate articles across consecutive digests, deduplication query <2 seconds

### Scenario 5: Standalone Mock Operation

**Given** environment variables set (USE_MOCK_AI_MODULE=true, USE_MOCK_BACKEND_MODULE=true, USE_MOCK_SES=true), mock data files exist (/mock-data/ai-articles-mock.json with 10 articles, /mock-data/user-requests-mock.json with 3 users), no external services running

**When** publishing module executes end-to-end flow

**Then** system loads mock mode, reads user requests from JSON (returns 1 pending request with topics ["AI"]), reads articles from JSON (filters by tags, returns 5 articles), renders email template with mock articles, calls mock SES implementation (logs to console instead of sending: "[MOCK SES] Would send email to: mock-user@example.com"), creates dispatch log with mock message_id, all core functionality verified without external dependencies

**Measurement**: All operations complete successfully in mock mode, developer can test locally without Docker Compose infrastructure

---

## Section 7: Edge Cases

**Email Delivery Failures**:
- **EC-1**: SES API timeout/503 error → Retry 3x with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s), alert admin if all fail
- **EC-2**: Hard bounce (permanent delivery failure) → Mark subscription inactive, log reason, stop future sends
- **EC-3**: Soft bounce (mailbox full) → Retry after 7 days, treat as hard bounce if second failure
- **EC-4**: Rate limit exceeded → Queue for next send window, log warning, don't retry immediately
- **EC-5**: Invalid email format → Mark subscription invalid, pause sends, flag for manual review

**User Management**:
- **EC-6**: User unsubscribes mid-digest → Cancel pending send, update status to unsubscribed, don't log as failure
- **EC-7**: Duplicate subscription request → Return existing subscription, send "already subscribed" email
- **EC-8**: User updates preferences during digest prep → Use new preferences for next digest, complete current with old

**Content Issues**:
- **EC-9**: No articles match user tags → Send "no content this period" email, suggest tag expansion
- **EC-10**: Article content missing/malformed → Exclude from digest, log warning, continue with remaining

**System Failures**:
- **EC-11**: Database connection lost mid-transaction → Rollback automatically, show "temporary error", operation retryable
- **EC-12**: AI module unavailable → Retry 3x with backoff, mark request failed after 3 attempts, skip user
- **EC-13**: Backend returns no pending requests → Log "no pending requests", sleep 5 minutes, poll again

**Concurrency**:
- **EC-14**: Two processes update same subscription → Last write wins with version increment, audit log both attempts
- **EC-15**: User deletes account during send → Cancel send immediately, mark user_deleted, cleanup data
