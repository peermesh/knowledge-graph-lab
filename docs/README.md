# Knowledge Graph Lab

Knowledge Graph Lab is an AI-powered research platform that transforms scattered information into actionable insights for the creator economy.

## Core Capabilities

Knowledge Graph Lab delivers four main capabilities to help users navigate the creator economy:

- **Discovers**: Monitors hundreds of sources (RSS, APIs, websites) to find opportunities:
  - Grants: Platform creator programs, community accelerators
  - Partnerships: Collaboration opportunities, community partnerships
  - Platform updates: Creator program features, platform tools and resources

- **Understands**: Builds knowledge graphs mapping entities (YouTube, MrBeast, Google) and relationships (Google owns YouTube, grants require platform accounts) from unstructured text.

- **Reasons**: Identifies patterns like seasonal grant cycles, platform migration trends, and collaboration opportunities across different creator communities.

- **Delivers**: Distributes insights through web interface, email digests, API endpoints, and webhooks - each personalized to user interests and preferences.

## Quick Start
