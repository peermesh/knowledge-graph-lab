# Project Handover: Knowledge Graph Lab Alpha
**Date**: 2025-09-22-14-03
**Session Focus**: Phase 2 PRD Preparation and Architecture Corrections

## Project Status Summary

### Work Completed This Session

1. **Removed Time Estimates** from all Phase 1 and Phase 2 task documents
   - Phase 2 PRD simplified guide (already clean)
   - Phase 2 PRD tasks
   - Phase 1 all tasks
   - Phase 1 research-only tasks
   - Reason: Juniors were gaming the time estimates

2. **Created Junior Worksheets** for simplified PRD writing
   - Location: `.dev/team/plan/phase-2-junior-worksheets/`
   - 4 module worksheets with essential features (5-6 per module)
   - Concrete code examples and fill-in-the-blank PRD sections
   - AI helper prompts for acceleration

3. **Corrected AI Module Architecture**
   - AI now generates **standalone news reports** with URLs (not emails)
   - Each report is a complete article with headline, lead, body
   - Reports stored in Backend with unique URLs
   - Publishing queries and assembles reports into emails

4. **Updated All Documentation** to reflect correct architecture
   - Senior specs: AI module generates news reports
   - Senior specs: Publishing module queries and assembles
   - Junior worksheets: Updated to show correct data flow
   - Integration docs: Created AI-Publishing pipeline documentation

## Key Decisions from This Session

1. **Two-Track PRD System**
   - Senior developers: Constitutional/architectural PRDs
   - Junior developers: Simplified technical PRDs with essential features only

2. **Essential Features Only**
   - Backend: 5 features (DB, ingestion, APIs, auth, Docker)
   - AI: 6 features (complete pipeline including report generation)
   - Frontend: 5 features (core views)
   - Publishing: 5 features (query, assemble, send)

3. **News Report Architecture**
   - AI generates standalone journalistic articles
   - Backend stores reports with URLs
   - Publishing independently queries and assembles
   - Clean separation of concerns

## Priority Next Steps

1. **Complete Module Feature Definitions**
   - Review all module specs for completeness
   - Add any missing essential features
   - Ensure Frontend can display news reports

2. **Documentation Consistency Audit**
   - Check all docs for correct AI output references
   - Update any remaining email generation mentions
   - Verify Backend specs include reports table

3. **Junior Team Meeting**
   - Present worksheets
   - Explain news report architecture
   - Walk through PRD sections

4. **Integration Specifications**
   - Document report flow pipeline
   - Define URL structures
   - Specify query interfaces

5. **Template Creation**
   - News report prompts for AI
   - Email assembly templates for Publishing

## Critical Technical Notes

### Architecture Corrections Made

**Before (Incorrect):**
```
AI Module → Generates Email Content → Publishing → Subscribers
```

**After (Correct):**
```
AI Module → Generates News Reports → Backend Storage (with URLs)
                                            ↓
                                    Publishing Queries
                                    Assembles Emails
                                            ↓
                                      Subscribers
```

### Report Structure
```json
{
  "report_id": "uuid",
  "url": "/reports/2025-09-22/headline-slug",
  "headline": "string",
  "lead": "paragraph",
  "body": "full article",
  "metadata": {
    "entities": ["array"],
    "topics": ["array"],
    "priority": "breaking|analysis|standard"
  }
}
```

### Files Modified

**Task Documents:**
- `.dev/team/plan/tasks/phase-2-prd-tasks.md`
- `.dev/team/plan/tasks/phase-1-all-tasks.md`
- `.dev/team/plan/tasks/phase-1-research-only-tasks.md`

**Junior Worksheets:**
- `.dev/team/plan/phase-2-junior-worksheets/Backend-Module-Worksheet.md`
- `.dev/team/plan/phase-2-junior-worksheets/AI-Module-Worksheet.md`
- `.dev/team/plan/phase-2-junior-worksheets/Frontend-Module-Worksheet.md`
- `.dev/team/plan/phase-2-junior-worksheets/Publishing-Module-Worksheet.md`
- `.dev/team/plan/phase-2-junior-worksheets/README.md`

**Senior Specifications:**
- `docs/modules/ai-development/AI-Development-Spec.md`
- `docs/modules/publishing-tools/Publishing-Tools-Spec.md`
- `docs/design/system/ai-publishing-integration.md` (new)

## Important Reminders

1. **Keep Worksheets Updated**: When module features change, update junior worksheets
2. **News Reports are Standalone**: Each has a URL, not tied to email
3. **Publishing is Independent**: Queries reports, doesn't receive them directly
4. **Junior PRDs**: Should reflect essential features only, not arbitrary counts

## Configuration Context
- Project uses `AGENTS.md` for AI configuration
- References `CLAUDE.md` in home directory
- Phase 2 focused on PRD writing, not implementation
- Juniors need concrete examples, not abstract patterns
