1. **Compare Discovery vs Requirements** decisions
2. **Identify missing or conflicting** decisions
3. **Update Requirements Kit** to align with Discovery
4. **Re-run decision alignment verification**
5. **Review process** for catching misalignments earlier

### Performance Alerts

#### Slow Validation Scripts (Warning)
**Symptoms**: Script execution time > 10 seconds

**Response**:

1. **Profile script performance** to identify bottlenecks

3. **Optimize slow operations** (caching, batching)
4. **Update performance baselines** if improvements made
5. **Monitor for sustained** improvement

#### Pipeline Throughput Degraded (Warning)
**Symptoms**: Pipeline processing < 8 kits/hour

**Response**:
