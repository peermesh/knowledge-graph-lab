## 8. INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITIES

### For Multi-Layer Search (Basic → RAG → Vector → Graph)
1. Use `VAULT-ADVANCED-MODE.md` for semantic query routing
2. Apply `GRAPHRAG-OPERATIONS-GUIDE.md` for hybrid search
3. Implement path filtering for domain-scoped queries

### For Self-Improving Ontology Mapping
1. Study `RESEARCH-LIBRARIAN-MODE.md` state-based organization
2. Apply machine-readable index schema from vault modes
3. Use confidence scoring from LLM extraction patterns

### For Lateral Thinking / Creative Inference
1. Multi-model research pattern from `DEEP-RESEARCH-MODE.md`
2. Community detection for unexpected connections
3. Graph-based reasoning for multi-hop discovery

### For Pattern Recognition & Prediction
1. Temporal context from ontology triples
2. Provenance tracking for trend analysis
3. Feedback loop integration for preference learning
