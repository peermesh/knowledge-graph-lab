## KEY ARCHITECTURE INSIGHT

The Knowledge Graph Lab is architected as a **two-loop knowledge engine**:

**Inner Processing Loop:**
Query → Search → Ingest → Extract → Merge → Store

**Outer Reasoning Loop:**
Gap detection → Query refinement → Convergence checking → Conflict resolution → Confidence assessment

The frontend tool visualizes both loops, making the KGL pipeline debuggable and transparent.
