# Research Tools and Methodology

## Overview

This directory contains the original research tools and methodologies developed for the Knowledge Graph Lab project. These tools enable systematic, high-quality research using the Deep Research Prompt Generator.

## The Original Research System

Located in `prompts/` directory:
- **[deep-research-prompt-generator.md](prompts/deep-research-prompt-generator.md)** - The Deep Research Prompt Generator

These are the original, battle-tested research tools developed specifically for high-quality, multi-model research.

## Research Process

1. **Define your research question** - What do you need to know?
2. **Use the deep research prompt generator** - Transform your question into comprehensive research prompts
3. **Run in multiple AI tools** - Get diverse perspectives:
   - Perplexity (web search with citations)
   - Claude (deep analysis and reasoning)
   - ChatGPT (broad knowledge and creativity)
   - Gemini (large context window)
4. **Save all responses** - Keep original outputs organized
5. **Produce final research** - Comprehensive, actionable research document

## File Organization

When conducting research, organize your files like this:

```
research/[your-topic]/
├── prompt.md           # Your research prompt
├── perplexity.md      # Response from Perplexity
├── claude.md          # Response from Claude
├── chatgpt.md         # Response from ChatGPT
├── gemini.md          # Response from Gemini
└── FINAL.md           # Final combined document
```

## Important Notes

- These are **simple tools** designed for practical use
- No complex JSON formats or automation needed
- Focus on getting good research results, not process complexity
- If you need help, ask your module lead

## What This Is NOT

This is NOT the complex testing system you might see elsewhere in the project. That system is for advanced testing and experimentation. These tools are specifically for team member research tasks.

**Questions?** These tools are meant to be simple and practical. If something seems overly complex, you're probably looking at the wrong system.
