gap: "Unknown whether existing frameworks (AutoGen, LangChain/LangGraph, CrewAI) provide sufficient multi-agent orchestration capabilities for autonomous research execution, or if custom task planning is required. Need comparison of framework maturity, learning curve, and customization flexibility."
impact: "Research orchestration is Layer 3 - the core intelligence layer. Framework choice determines development velocity, maintenance burden, and ability to implement complex research workflows. Wrong choice costs 2-3 months of rework."

## Research Metadata

**Research Track:** 03-research-orchestration-research (Part 1: Frameworks)
**Topic:** Multi-Agent Orchestration Frameworks Evaluation

### Research Objectives

1. **Framework vs Custom?** Do existing frameworks handle our orchestration needs or must we build custom?
2. **Best Framework?** Which framework (AutoGen, LangChain, CrewAI) best fits our requirements?
3. **Task Planning?** How do frameworks handle complex multi-step research workflows?
4. **Learning Curve?** How long to become productive with each framework?
5. **Customization?** Can frameworks be extended for domain-specific research patterns?

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All 3 major frameworks evaluated with hands-on examples
- [ ] Task complexity assessment (simple vs multi-step vs conditional workflows)
- [ ] Learning curve quantified (hours to first working example)
- [ ] Customization flexibility tested (can we add domain-specific logic?)
- [ ] Clear recommendation with confidence level

### Frameworks to Evaluate (Minimum 3)

1. **AutoGen** - Microsoft multi-agent framework
2. **LangChain + LangGraph** - Workflow orchestration ecosystem
3. **CrewAI** - Role-based multi-agent system
4. **Custom Implementation** - Baseline comparison (pure Python/FastAPI)

### Research Methodology

**Hands-On Testing:**
- Implement 2-3 sample research workflows in each framework
- Measure lines of code, setup complexity, execution reliability
- Test failure handling and error recovery
- Evaluate debugging and observability

**Evaluation Dimensions:**
- Maturity: Production-ready or experimental?
- Learning curve: Hours to productive workflow
- Complexity handling: Simple vs multi-step vs conditional logic
- Customization: Can we add domain-specific extensions?
- Observability: Can we monitor and debug agent behavior?
- Community: Active development, documentation quality

### Expected Output

≥3,500 word technical report including:
- Framework comparison matrix
- Implementation examples for each framework
- Learning curve analysis (time to proficiency)
- Complexity handling assessment
- Customization flexibility evaluation
- Recommendation with implementation roadmap
