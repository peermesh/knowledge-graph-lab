gap: "Unknown which gap detection algorithms achieve 85%+ precision (correctly identify true gaps without false positives) while maintaining reasonable Neo4j Cypher query performance (<100ms per gap check) for analyzing knowledge graph completeness."
impact: "Gap detection drives the research orchestration layer. Poor precision wastes resources researching non-gaps. Slow queries add latency to every user request. Determines whether we use simple Cypher queries, specialized graph algorithms, or ML-based approaches for gap detection."

## Research Metadata

**Research Track:** 02-gap-detection-research
**Topic:** Gap Detection Algorithms and Neo4j Performance

### Research Objectives

1. **Algorithm Selection?** What algorithms detect KG gaps effectively (missing entities, relationships, attributes)?
2. **Neo4j Performance?** Which Cypher query patterns give best performance for gap detection?
3. **Confidence Scoring?** How do we assign confidence to detected gaps (is it really missing or just unknown)?
4. **Missing Entities vs Relationships?** Do we need different algorithms for different gap types?
5. **Precision vs Recall Trade off?** What's acceptable false positive rate vs coverage?

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Determined best gap detection approach with 85%+ precision
- [ ] Benchmarked Neo4j query performance (<100ms per gap check)
- [ ] Built proof-of-concept gap detector on sample graph
- [ ] Documented confidence scoring methodology
- [ ] Clear recommendation with tradeoff analysis

### Approaches to Evaluate (Minimum 3)

1. **Cypher Query Patterns** - Pattern matching for missing nodes/edges
2. **Graph Algorithms** - Centrality, clustering to identify sparse areas
3. **ML-Based Detection** - Learn what "complete" vs "incomplete" looks like
4. **Hybrid Approaches** - Combine multiple signals

### Research Methodology

**Testing Approach:**
- Create sample knowledge graph with known gaps
- Implement each gap detection approach
- Measure precision (% detected gaps are real) and recall (% real gaps detected)
- Benchmark Neo4j query latency
- Test at different graph scales (1K, 10K, 100K nodes)

**Evaluation Dimensions:**
- Precision: False positive rate (flagging non-gaps) target <15%
- Recall: Detection rate (finding real gaps) target >80%
- Latency: Query time in Neo4j target <100ms
- Scalability: How does performance degrade with graph size?
- Interpretability: Can we explain why a gap was detected?
- Resource usage: Memory and CPU requirements

### Expected Output

≥3,000 word technical report including:
- Algorithm comparison matrix
- Precision/recall metrics per approach
- Neo4j performance benchmarks (latency distributions)
- Graph scale testing results
- Cypher query examples for top approach
- Clear recommendation with confidence scoring strategy
- Integration guidance for orchestration layer
