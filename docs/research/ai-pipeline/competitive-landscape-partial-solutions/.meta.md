gap: "If no single commercial platform provides a complete 8-layer autonomous research-enrichment pipeline, what are the best-of-breed open-source tools, academic solutions, and state-of-the-art approaches for each individual layer? Can we successfully compose multiple tools into a unified system? What would the composition cost and feasibility look like?"
impact: "Enables layer-by-layer architectural decisions and tool stack recommendations. Directly informs implementation planning and cost projections. Provides academic grounding for chosen approaches. Unblocks Tracks 01-08 research by providing specific tool recommendations and SOTA context for each layer."

## Research Metadata

**Research Track:** 00-COMPETITIVE-LANDSCAPE-RESEARCH
**Topic:** Partial Solutions, Layer-by-Layer Analysis & Academic SOTA

### The 8 Layers

1. **Question Understanding & Intent Detection** - Parse and understand user query
2. **Knowledge Gap Detection** - Identify what we don't know
3. **Research Orchestration & Source Selection** - Multi-step research coordination
4. **Document Acquisition & Processing** - Fetch and parse documents
5. **Entity & Relationship Extraction** - NER and relation extraction
6. **Knowledge Graph Construction & Merging** - Build and deduplicate graph
7. **Quality Validation & Confidence Scoring** - Assess extraction quality
8. **Answer Generation & Graph Query** - Generate response from graph

### Research Objectives

For each layer, determine:
1. **Best-of-breed open-source tools** (ranked by fitness to requirements)
2. **Academic state-of-the-art** (what's the research frontier?)
3. **Accuracy/performance benchmarks** (cite papers, not speculation)
4. **Cost analysis** (licensing, compute, API costs)
5. **Integration effort** (1-5 scale for integration complexity)
6. **Gaps vs. ideal** (what's missing or imperfect?)

**Composition Questions:**
- Can 8+ tools work together or does integration complexity explode?
- Total composition cost compared to single-platform approach?
- Which layers have no good off-the-shelf solution?
- What custom code would still be needed?

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Clear tool recommendation for each of 8 layers
- [ ] Each recommendation cites academic SOTA (paper + benchmark)
- [ ] Layer-by-layer composition cost analysis
- [ ] Integration complexity assessment (feasible or too complex?)
- [ ] Gap analysis (which layers need custom building?)
- [ ] Composition feasibility recommendation (yes/no/maybe)

### Research Methodology

**For each layer:**

1. **Identify top tools** (3-5 candidates)
   - GitHub projects (100+ stars, active commits)
   - Hugging Face models/tools
   - Academic implementations (Papers with Code)
   - Commercial tools with OSS versions

2. **Evaluate each tool:**
   - Accuracy on published benchmarks (cite papers)
   - Cost: licensing, compute, API calls
   - Integration effort: 1-5 scale
   - Community/maintenance status
   - Known limitations and gaps

3. **Academic SOTA:**
   - Recent papers (2023-2025) on this layer
   - Key breakthroughs and techniques
   - Benchmarks from published research
   - Research vs. production gap

4. **Compare and rank:**
   - Which tool is best for our requirements?
   - Why others fell short
   - Integration difficulty with other layers

### Expected Output

**Part 1: Executive Summary**
- Can we compose 8 tools successfully? (yes/no/risky)
