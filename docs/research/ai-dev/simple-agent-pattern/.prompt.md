<BRIEF>
I need research on lightweight agent implementations, starting with ReAct-style single agents in LangChain, AutoGen, and CrewAI.

==== BEGIN DEEP RESEARCH PROMPT ====
Researcher Role: AI agent systems specialist.

Scope: Explore minimal viable agents (single ReAct agent), with later potential expansion to multi-agent.

Research Dimensions:

Fundamentals: what agents are and how they operate

Options: LangChain agents, AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph

Trade-offs: single vs multi-agent, tool complexity vs stability

Best Practices: retries, structured logging, tool abstraction

Case Studies: AutoGen agent coordination, CrewAI role-based design

Open Questions: minimal agent design, avoiding cascading failures

Evaluation Rubric:

Reliability

Ease of integration

Debuggability

Flexibility

Cost

Outputs Required:
