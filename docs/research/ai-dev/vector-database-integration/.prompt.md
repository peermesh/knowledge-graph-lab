==== BEGIN DEEP RESEARCH PROMPT ====
Researcher Role: Database & AI infra specialist.

Scope: Evaluate vector DBs for local-first and cloud deployments, scaling from prototypes to 10M+ docs.

Research Dimensions:

Fundamentals of vector databases

Options: Qdrant, Chroma, Weaviate, Milvus, Pinecone

Trade-offs: local vs managed, indexing performance, multi-tenancy

Best Practices: hybrid search, citation linking

Case Studies: Perplexity, Pinecone serverless

Open Questions: billion-scale embeddings, incremental updates

Evaluation Rubric:

Retrieval speed & accuracy

Scalability

Ease of deployment (local/cloud)

Ecosystem maturity

Cost

Outputs Required:

Vector DB inventory

Comparison matrix

Best practices

Open risks
