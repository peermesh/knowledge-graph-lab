# Feature Specification: Backend Architecture

**Feature Branch**: `001-backend-module`
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create comprehensive backend architecture for Knowledge Graph Lab System with user authentication, entity management, knowledge graph relationships, API endpoints, and multi-module integration"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Database Schema Management (Priority: P1)

As a backend developer implementing data storage for knowledge graph entities, I need to deploy and manage PostgreSQL database schemas with proper relationships, so that all modules can reliably store and query entity data with data integrity.

**Why this priority**: Database schema is the foundation of the entire system and must be established first to enable all other functionality. Without proper database design, the entire knowledge graph system cannot function.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating database migrations, running them in a test environment, and verifying schema creation and data integrity constraints work correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a clean PostgreSQL database, **When** I run database migrations, **Then** all tables are created with proper indexes and constraints
2. **Given** the database schema is deployed, **When** I insert test data with relationships, **Then** foreign key constraints are enforced
3. **Given** the database with existing data, **When** I run complex relationship queries, **Then** results return in under 500ms
4. **Given** a production database, **When** I apply schema changes via migrations, **Then** zero-downtime deployment is achieved

### User Story 2 - API Endpoint Development (Priority: P1)

As an API developer building interfaces for entity extraction and storage, I need FastAPI endpoints that handle CRUD operations for entities and relationships, so that the AI module can extract entities and the Frontend can display knowledge graphs.

**Why this priority**: API endpoints are the primary interface between modules and must be available for all other components to integrate with the backend system.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting the API service, running contract tests against endpoints, and verifying OpenAPI documentation is generated and accessible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the API service is running, **When** I make a GET request to list entities, **Then** I receive paginated results with proper JSON formatting
2. **Given** valid entity data, **When** I POST to create an entity, **Then** the entity is stored and I receive a 201 response with the created entity
3. **Given** an existing entity, **When** I PUT to update it, **Then** the entity is updated and I receive the updated data
4. **Given** an entity ID, **When** I DELETE the entity, **Then** the entity is removed and I receive a 204 response

---

### User Story 3 - Authentication System Management (Priority: P1)

As a security engineer implementing access control for the entire system, I need JWT-based authentication with role-based permissions, so that users and modules can securely access appropriate resources.

**Why this priority**: Security is fundamental to the system and must be implemented before any user data or sensitive operations are exposed.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating user accounts, attempting login/logout, testing token refresh, and verifying role-based access control works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** valid user credentials, **When** I attempt to login, **Then** I receive JWT access and refresh tokens
2. **Given** a valid access token, **When** I make authenticated API requests, **Then** I receive successful responses
3. **Given** an expired token, **When** I attempt to use it, **Then** I receive a 401 unauthorized response
4. **Given** a user with admin role, **When** I access admin endpoints, **Then** I receive successful responses

---

### User Story 4 - Message Queue Infrastructure (Priority: P2)

As a system architect coordinating async processing between modules, I need RabbitMQ message queues for reliable inter-module communication, so that entity extraction and content processing happen asynchronously.

**Why this priority**: Message queues enable scalable async processing but are not required for basic CRUD operations, making them secondary to core API functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting up RabbitMQ, publishing test messages, consuming them with workers, and verifying message delivery and processing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** RabbitMQ is running, **When** I publish a message to a queue, **Then** the message is delivered within 100ms
2. **Given** a worker service is consuming, **When** I send 1000 messages, **Then** all messages are processed successfully
3. **Given** a worker encounters an error, **When** message processing fails, **Then** the message is retried with exponential backoff
4. **Given** a message fails permanently, **When** retry limits are exceeded, **Then** the message goes to dead letter queue

---

### User Story 5 - Deployment and Monitoring (Priority: P2)

As a DevOps engineer maintaining production infrastructure, I need containerized deployment with health checks and monitoring, so that the backend services run reliably and issues are detected proactively.

**Why this priority**: Deployment and monitoring are essential for production operations but can be added after core functionality is working.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deploying services with Docker Compose, running health checks, and verifying monitoring endpoints and logs are working.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Docker Compose configuration, **When** I run docker-compose up, **Then** all services start within 10 minutes
2. **Given** services are running, **When** I check health endpoints, **Then** all services report healthy status
3. **Given** the system is under load, **When** I monitor metrics, **Then** performance data is collected and alerting works
4. **Given** a service fails, **When** I check logs, **Then** structured logs provide clear error information

---

### User Story 6 - AI Module Integration (Priority: P2)

As an AI engineer developing entity extraction capabilities, I need backend APIs for submitting content and retrieving extracted entities, so that the AI module can process content and store results in the knowledge graph.

**Why this priority**: AI integration extends core functionality but depends on having basic entity management working first.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting up AI worker service, submitting test content, and verifying entity extraction and storage works end-to-end.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the AI worker is running, **When** I submit content for processing, **Then** entities are extracted and stored within 2 seconds
2. **Given** multiple content submissions, **When** I process them in batch, **Then** up to 100 documents are handled concurrently
3. **Given** AI processing results, **When** I retrieve them, **Then** confidence scores are calculated and stored accurately
4. **Given** processing failures, **When** I check status, **Then** failures are retried and status is tracked

---

### User Story 7 - Frontend Module Integration (Priority: P3)

As a frontend developer building the user interface, I need REST APIs and WebSocket connections for real-time data access, so that users can interact with the knowledge graph and receive live updates.

**Why this priority**: Frontend integration is important for user experience but can be added after core backend functionality is stable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting up WebSocket connections, testing real-time updates, and verifying authentication token refresh works automatically.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the API supports WebSockets, **When** I establish a connection, **Then** real-time updates are received within 100ms
2. **Given** large datasets, **When** I request paginated results, **Then** pagination metadata is included in responses
3. **Given** an active session, **When** tokens are about to expire, **Then** they are refreshed automatically
4. **Given** user authentication, **When** I access protected endpoints, **Then** access is granted based on permissions

---

### User Story 8 - Publishing Module Integration (Priority: P3)

As a publishing engineer managing content distribution, I need backend APIs for content storage and engagement tracking, so that published content can be stored and user interactions monitored.

**Why this priority**: Publishing integration extends the system but is not essential for core knowledge graph functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by publishing content through APIs, tracking engagement metrics, and verifying filtering and aggregation works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** content up to 10MB, **When** I publish through the API, **Then** content is stored and indexed successfully
2. **Given** user interactions, **When** I track engagement, **Then** metrics are collected and aggregated within 5 seconds
3. **Given** multiple filter criteria, **When** I retrieve content, **Then** results are filtered accurately
4. **Given** publishing status changes, **When** I check updates, **Then** changes are propagated to all subscribed modules
