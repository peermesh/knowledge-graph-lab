# Tasks: Backend Architecture

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-backend-module/`
**Prerequisites**: spec.md, plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are MANDATORY per constitutional API Design & Testing principle and TDD approach.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Path Conventions

Based on the implementation plan, files are located in `.dev/ai/speckit-output/backend-module/` with the following structure:
- **Application**: `app/` (models, services, API routes, schemas)
- **Tests**: `tests/` (unit, integration, contract tests)
- **Infrastructure**: `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`
- **Configuration**: `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`, `.env.example`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create Docker containerization and Docker Compose configuration (Infrastructure as Code principle)
- [ ] T002 Initialize Python project with FastAPI dependencies in requirements.txt
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools (black, isort, flake8, mypy)
- [ ] T004 Setup project structure with app/, tests/, database/ directories
- [ ] T005 Create environment configuration template (.env.example) with all required variables

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

**Constitutional Requirements**: All foundational tasks MUST comply with Knowledge Graph Lab System Constitution:
- Infrastructure as Code: All services MUST be containerized using Docker
- Database Design: PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector extension and migrations
- API Design & Testing: RESTful APIs with OpenAPI documentation and testing
- Security & Authentication: OAuth2/JWT with user_id data isolation
- Observability & Monitoring: Structured logging and health endpoints

**Required Foundational Tasks**:

- [ ] T006 Setup PostgreSQL 15+ database with pgvector extension and version-controlled migrations in database/migrations/

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable
- **User Stories 4-5 (P2)**: Can start after P1 completion - Build on core functionality
- **User Stories 6-8 (P3)**: Can start after P2 completion - Extend system capabilities

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-3 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Database Schema)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (API Endpoints)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Authentication)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all P1 stories independently
7. Deploy/demo if ready - this is the MVP!

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP Complete!)
5. Add User Stories 4-5 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Stories 6-8 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Database)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (API)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Auth)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Team moves to P2 stories in parallel
5. Final polish and integration testing

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- All tasks include constitutional compliance notes for validation
- Implementation artifacts are available in `.dev/ai/speckit-output/backend-module/`
