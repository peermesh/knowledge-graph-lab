# Frontend Design Module Specification

## Compliance with Shared Module Requirements

**This module specification is governed by the Shared Module Requirements and must comply with all universal standards established therein.**

**OVERRIDING REQUIREMENT:** The Frontend module must implement both shared module specifications:

### ðŸ“‹ Standalone Module (Immediate Implementation)
**REQUIRED:** Basic interoperability for immediate team handover
- [Standalone Module](./shared/standalone-modules/README.md) - Container architecture, database, API standards
- **Handover Ready** - What teams implement immediately

### ðŸ”¬ PeerMesh Module (Advanced Features)
**FUTURE:** Advanced features building into PeerMesh Abstraction Program
- [PeerMesh Module](./shared/peermesh-modules/README.md) - Parallel search, event-driven architecture, dual authorization
- **Phase 2+** - Advanced interoperability features

**Any conflicts between this specification and shared requirements will be resolved in favor of the shared requirements.**

## Module Mission

The Frontend Design module creates the user interface that makes the Knowledge Graph Lab accessible and valuable to users. They own all user-facing components, interactions, and experiences.

## Responsibilities

### UI Components
Build React components for:

- Search interface with autocomplete and filters
- Results display in both list and graph views
- User profiles and preference settings
- Saved searches and alert configuration
- Data export functionality
- **Admin Dashboard** (Admin-only access):
  - Real-time pipeline monitoring and metrics
  - System performance and health indicators
  - AI processing queue status and throughput
  - Entity extraction accuracy and confidence metrics
  - Error rates and failure analysis
  - Configuration management interface
  - User activity and usage analytics

### State Management
Use Redux for complex state management:

- Application state across components
- User session management
- Cached search results and filters
- Optimistic UI updates
- Offline capability

Research state management requirements:

- What state needs to be managed across the application?
- How to structure state for optimal performance and maintainability?
- What patterns support time-travel debugging and optimistic updates?
- How to handle complex state synchronization across components?

### Data Visualization
Create interactive visualizations using:

- Graph visualizations showing entity relationships (D3.js recommended)
- Charts and metrics dashboards
- Timeline views for opportunities
- Network diagrams for connections
- Heat maps for activity patterns
- **Admin Pipeline Monitoring**:
  - Real-time throughput charts (entities processed per minute)
  - Queue depth and processing latency graphs
  - Error rate trends and failure analysis
  - System resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk)
  - AI model performance metrics (confidence scores, accuracy)
  - Data ingestion pipeline status indicators

Research graph visualization approaches:

- What libraries and techniques best handle large-scale knowledge graphs?
- How to implement force-directed layouts that remain performant with 1000+ nodes?
- What interaction patterns make graph exploration intuitive for users?
- How to balance visual clarity with information density in complex graphs?

### Responsive Design
Ensure the interface works across devices:

- Desktop layouts using CSS Grid
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Progressive Web App capabilities
- Adaptive layouts for tablets

### User Workflows
Build complete user journeys:

- Search flow from query to results
- Saved search management
- Alert configuration and preferences
- Data export in multiple formats
- Onboarding and tutorials
- **Admin Workflows** (Admin-only):
  - Pipeline monitoring and performance tuning
  - System configuration and parameter adjustment
  - User management and access control
  - Error investigation and troubleshooting
  - Performance analysis and optimization
  - Data quality assessment and validation

### API Integration
Connect to backend services:

- REST API endpoints for CRUD operations
- GraphQL for complex queries
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Handle loading and error states
- Implement retry logic and offline queuing
- **Admin API Integration**:
  - Real-time metrics and monitoring endpoints
  - System health and performance APIs
  - Configuration management endpoints
  - User and access control APIs
  - Error reporting and diagnostic endpoints
  - Pipeline status and control APIs

Research API integration patterns:

- What are effective patterns for organizing API calls in frontend applications?
- How to handle loading states, errors, and retries gracefully?
- What strategies work best for real-time updates via WebSockets?
- How to implement efficient caching and request deduplication?

### Performance Optimization
Ensure fast, smooth interactions:

- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Code splitting by route
- Browser caching strategies
- Virtual scrolling for long lists
- Sub-second response times

## Module Boundaries

### What This Module Does NOT Do
- **Don't build backend APIs** - Backend Architecture handles all API development
- **Don't process or analyze data** - AI Development handles all data processing
- **Don't manage infrastructure** - Backend Architecture handles servers and deployment
- **Don't design notification distribution** - Publishing Tools handles email/Slack/webhooks
- **Don't make data modeling decisions** - Backend Architecture owns database schemas

### Clear Operational Boundaries
- You consume APIs, not create them
- You display AI results, not generate them
- You visualize data, not store it
- You handle UI state, not business logic
- You design interfaces, not data structures

## Interfaces with Other Modules

### To Backend Architecture
- **API requests** - CRUD operations on entities
- **Search queries** - User search parameters
- **User actions** - Clicks, saves, exports

- **Confidence scores** - Reliability indicators for each insight
- **Entity relationships** - Graph data in JSON format
- **Streaming responses** - Progressive AI output updates
