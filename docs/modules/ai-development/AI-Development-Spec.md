# AI Development Module Specification

## Module Mission

The AI Development module builds the intelligence layer that transforms unstructured text into structured knowledge. They own all AI/ML components for entity extraction, relationship mapping, and insight generation.

## What You Build

### Entity Extraction
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extract organizations, people, funding amounts, dates, and locations from text
- **Custom Entity Types**: Build extractors for domain-specific entities (grants, partnerships, events)
- **Multi-language Support**: Handle entity extraction across different languages and formats
- **Accuracy Target**: 90% precision, 85% recall by Phase 3

### Relationship Mapping
- **Connection Discovery**: Identify who funds whom, who partners with whom, who competes with whom
- **Relationship Types**: Fund, partner, acquire, compete, collaborate, mention
- **Temporal Tracking**: Track how relationships change over time
- **Graph Construction**: Build knowledge graphs from extracted relationships
- **Accuracy Target**: 80% precision for relationship identification

### Confidence Scoring
- **Source Reliability**: Score based on source credibility (official sites = high, social media = medium)
- **Context Analysis**: Higher confidence for entities mentioned multiple times
- **Extraction Certainty**: Score based on model confidence and pattern matching strength
- **Aggregate Scoring**: Weighted average formula: (source_score * 0.3) + (context_score * 0.4) + (model_confidence * 0.3)
- **Implementation**: Use 0-100 scale with validation thresholds at 70 (medium) and 85 (high)

### Prompt Engineering
- **Template Design**: Create reusable prompts for different extraction tasks
- **Output Formatting**: Design prompts that return structured JSON/XML consistently
- **Few-shot Examples**: Build example libraries for better extraction accuracy
- **Resource Optimization**: Balance prompt complexity with computational resources

### Model Management
- **Model Selection**: Choose between GPT-4, Claude, Llama based on task requirements
- **Fine-tuning**: Improve models for specific extraction tasks when needed
- **Version Control**: Track model versions and performance metrics
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track accuracy, speed, and resource usage per extraction

### Data Pipeline
Transform raw text into knowledge:
1. **Input**: Raw documents from Backend (HTML, PDF, text)
2. **Chunking**: Split into processable segments (1000-2000 tokens)
3. **Extraction**: Pull entities and relationships from chunks
4. **Validation**: Check extracted data for consistency and format compliance
5. **Error Handling**: Retry failed extractions with fallback approaches
6. **Output**: Structured JSON with entities, relationships, and confidence scores

### News Report Generation & Synthesis
Transform extracted knowledge into standalone news-style reports:
- **Prompt-Driven Generation**: Use configurable prompts to generate news reports in specific styles
- **Content Synthesis**: Aggregate and analyze findings from multiple sources into coherent narratives
- **Report Types**: Generate different report formats based on content type:
  - Breaking news (urgent developments)
  - Analysis pieces (trends and patterns)
  - Market updates (financial/funding news)
  - Research summaries (academic/technical findings)
- **Standalone Reports**: Each report is a complete, independent article:
  - Has unique ID and URL
  - Self-contained with all context
  - Written in journalistic style
  - Includes headline, lead, body, and conclusion
- **Tagging & Metadata**: Apply comprehensive categorization:
  - Topic tags (technology, healthcare, finance)
  - Priority levels (breaking, important, standard)
  - Entity tags (companies, people, products mentioned)
  - Relevance scoring for discovery
