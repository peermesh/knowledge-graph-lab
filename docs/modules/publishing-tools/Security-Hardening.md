# Publishing Module - Security Hardening

## Overview

Security measures for the Publishing Module to protect against common attack vectors and ensure data privacy.

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Integration

- All API endpoints require JWT bearer tokens from Backend module
- Token validation handled by `src/publishing/core/auth.py` (future)
- Role-based access control: `user`, `admin`, `moderator`
- Token expiration: 1 hour with refresh token rotation

### API Key Management

- External service credentials stored in environment variables
- Never commit API keys or secrets to version control
- Use `.env` files for local development (ignored by git)
- Production credentials managed via secrets manager

## Input Validation

### Request Validation

- Pydantic schemas enforce type safety and validation rules
- UUID validation for all ID parameters
- Email format validation for subscriber emails
- Content length limits: max 100 articles per publication
- JSON schema validation for JSONB fields

### SQL Injection Prevention

- SQLAlchemy ORM parameterized queries prevent injection
- No raw SQL string concatenation
- Validate all user inputs before database operations

## Rate Limiting

### API Rate Limits

- Standard endpoints: 1,000 requests/minute per user
- Analytics endpoints: 100 requests/minute per user
- Channel testing: 10 requests/minute per channel
- Implemented via `src/publishing/services/rate_limiter.py`

### Protection Against Abuse

- Rate limiting headers in responses: `X-RateLimit-*`
- Exponential backoff for repeated violations
- IP-based rate limiting for unauthenticated requests
- Circuit breakers for external service protection

## Data Protection

### Encryption

- TLS 1.3 for all data in transit
- AES-256 encryption for PII data at rest
- Secure credential storage with encryption at rest
- HTTPS-only for all API endpoints

### GDPR Compliance

- Right to deletion: `DELETE /api/v1/subscribers/{id}`
- Data export: preference data export API
- Consent tracking: subscription status management
- Data retention: 2 years for analytics, 1 year for preferences

## Content Security

### XSS Prevention

- HTML escaping for all user-generated content
- Content Security Policy headers
- Template sanitization before rendering
- No inline JavaScript in templates

### CORS Configuration

- Strict CORS policy for production
- Allowed origins configured via environment variables
- Credentials included only for trusted origins

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Security Events

- Failed authentication attempts logged
- Rate limit violations tracked
- Suspicious activity patterns detected
- Audit trail for all data modifications

### Incident Response

- Automated alerting for security events
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- Structured logging for forensic analysis
- Regular security audit logs

## Dependency Management

### Security Updates

- Regular dependency updates for security patches
- Automated vulnerability scanning (Dependabot)
- Pin dependency versions in `requirements.txt`
- Security audit before production releases

### Third-Party Integrations

- AWS SES: TLS encryption, DKIM/SPF authentication
- Slack/Discord: Bot token security, permission scoping
- Redis: Password authentication, network isolation
- PostgreSQL: Connection encryption, role-based access

## Testing

### Security Tests

- JWT authentication validation
- Input sanitization tests
- Rate limiting enforcement tests
- SQL injection prevention tests
- XSS vulnerability tests

See `tests/publishing/security/` for security test implementations.

## Production Checklist

- [ ] Enable TLS 1.3 for all endpoints
- [ ] Configure rate limiting for all API routes
- [ ] Validate JWT tokens on all protected endpoints
- [ ] Enable audit logging for sensitive operations
- [ ] Configure CORS for production domains
- [ ] Set up secrets manager for credentials
- [ ] Enable automated vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Configure security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [ ] Review and update security policies quarterly
