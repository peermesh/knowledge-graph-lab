# Publishing Tools Module Specification

## Module Mission

The Publishing Tools module delivers insights to users through their preferred channels at the right time. This module owns all notification, distribution, and content formatting systems that ensure insights reach users effectively.

## Responsibilities

### 1. Multi-Channel Distribution
- **Email newsletters**: Build integration with SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES for reliable delivery
- **Slack/Discord bots**: Create bot integrations that post opportunities to team channels
- **Webhooks**: Implement HTTP POST endpoints for real-time event notifications
- **RSS feeds**: Generate standard RSS/Atom feeds for aggregator compatibility
- **API endpoints**: Provide REST endpoints for third-party integrations

### 2. Personalization Engine
- **Match opportunities to user profiles**: Apply user interests, industry, and criteria to filter opportunities
- **Filter by relevance**: Score opportunities using user preferences and past engagement
- **Rank by importance**: Sort opportunities by deadline, funding amount, and match strength

### 3. Scheduling System
- **Daily digests**: Send consolidated opportunities at user-specified times
- **Weekly summaries**: Generate overview of top opportunities from the week
- **Instant alerts**: Push urgent opportunities (closing soon, perfect match) immediately

### 4. Content Formatting
- **HTML emails**: Design responsive templates that work across email clients
- **Slack blocks**: Format messages using Slack's Block Kit for rich interactions
- **Plain text**: Generate accessible text versions for all content
- **Markdown**: Support GitHub-style markdown for technical channels

### 5. Subscription Management
- **User preferences**: Store channel selection, frequency, topics of interest
- **Frequency settings**: Daily, weekly, instant, or custom schedules
- **Channel selection**: Enable/disable specific delivery channels per user
- **Unsubscribe handling**: One-click unsubscribe with CAN-SPAM compliance

### 6. Analytics Tracking
- **Open rates**: Track email opens using pixel tracking
- **Click rates**: Monitor which opportunities users engage with
- **Opportunity engagement**: Measure time spent, shares, and saves
- **Channel effectiveness**: Compare performance across delivery channels

### 7. Template System
- **Customizable templates**: Create templates for grants, partnerships, events, news
- **User segment templates**: Design different formats for creators vs enterprises
- **A/B testing**: Test subject lines, content layout, send times

## Module Boundaries

### What They DON'T Do
- **Don't generate insights**: AI module extracts and creates the insights
- **Don't store user data**: Backend module handles all database operations
- **Don't build web UI**: Frontend module creates user interfaces
- **Don't fetch source data**: Backend module manages data ingestion
- **Don't make relevance decisions without user preferences**: Only filter based on explicit user settings

## Interfaces with Other Modules

### From Backend Module
- **User profiles**: JSON with preferences, interests, past engagement
- **New insights**: Structured data with entities, relationships, confidence scores
- **Scheduling triggers**: Cron jobs or event-based triggers for sends

### To Backend Module
- **Delivery status**: Success/failure for each send attempt
- **Engagement metrics**: Opens, clicks, unsubscribes per message

### From AI Module
- **Formatted insights**: Pre-processed content with title, description, entities
- **Confidence scores**: 0-100 confidence for each extracted fact

### External APIs
- **SendGrid/Mailgun/SES**: Email delivery services
- **Slack/Discord APIs**: Bot messaging endpoints
- **Zapier/Make**: Automation platform webhooks

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success - Research & Planning
- **Email provider research**: Compare SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES with cost analysis at 1K, 10K, 100K subscriber tiers and API documentation
- **Integration proof-of-concept**: Send test email using selected provider with basic HTML template (verify delivery, rendering across email clients, and engagement tracking)
- **Channel comparison matrix**: Document technical requirements and capabilities for email, Slack, and webhooks with specific API limitations
- **API specification draft**: Define REST endpoints for subscription management and delivery status with authentication schemas
- **Security requirements**: Document authentication, rate limiting, and data protection needs including GDPR compliance

### Phase 2 Success - Planning
- 10-page PRD with complete distribution pipeline specifications
- Channel integration architecture defined for email, Slack, webhooks
- Template system design with personalization rules
- Delivery scheduling algorithm documented
- Analytics and engagement tracking framework specified

### Phase 3 Success - MVP
- Email notifications working with 95% delivery rate and measurable bounce rates below 2%
- Basic personalization by keywords functioning with user preference matching
- Daily digest scheduling operational with timezone support
- Template system for 3 content types (grants, partnerships, events)

### Phase 4 Success - Enhancement
- Multi-channel distribution working (email + 2 additional channels)
- Advanced personalization with A/B testing capabilities
- Real-time delivery option for high-priority alerts
- Engagement analytics dashboard with key metrics
- Unsubscribe management and preference center
- Template library expanded to 10+ content types
- Delivery optimization based on engagement patterns

### Phase 5 Success - Final
- 5+ channel integrations live (email, Slack, Discord, webhooks, RSS)
- Advanced personalization using engagement history
- Real-time alerts delivered in under 1 minute
- 50% email open rate, 20% click rate achieved

## Technical Context They Need

Users want insights delivered to where they already work (email, Slack, Discord). They need personalization to their specific interests and needs. The system must balance completeness with frequency to avoid overwhelming users. Deliverability and engagement rates are critical - unread insights have no value.

The platform processes thousands of information sources daily. Each user may have different relevance criteria and preferred channels. Some want everything immediately, others want weekly summaries. The system must handle both extremes efficiently while maintaining high delivery rates across all channels.
