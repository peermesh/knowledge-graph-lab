# Project Constitution: Knowledge Graph Lab

## Vision
Transform information chaos into actionable intelligence through an AI-powered research platform that discovers opportunities, understands relationships, and delivers personalized insights for the creator economy.

**What We're Building**: An intelligent research system that automatically scans hundreds of sources, understands relationships between entities using AI and graph databases, and delivers personalized insights instead of forcing creators to search through fragmented information.

**Why Now**: Three converging factors make this the perfect moment:
1. **LLMs Can Extract Structured Data** - Modern AI models can read content and extract grants, opportunities, platform changes, and partnerships automatically
2. **Graph Databases Scale** - Technology has matured to handle complex relationship mapping at production scale
3. **Compute Costs Dropped** - Processing capabilities are now accessible, making continuous automated research viable

**Target Impact**: Reduce creator research time from 10+ hours per week to under 30 minutes while improving opportunity discovery rates by 300%.

## Operating Principles

### Spec-Driven Development
- **Comprehensive Requirements First**: Spend 2-4 days gathering requirements (800-1500 lines) before implementation
- **RequirementsKit Methodology**: Follow structured requirements gathering process before SpecKit processing
- **Implementation-Ready Specifications**: All specs must be 400-600 lines with all details resolved
- **No Implementation Without Specs**: Reference specifications for all architectural decisions

### Modular Architecture
- **Independent Modules**: Four modules (AI, Backend, Frontend, Publishing) evolve separately
- **Loose Coupling**: Modules integrate through well-defined APIs and interfaces
- **Clear Dependencies**: Module development follows: AI → Backend → Frontend → Publishing
- **Integration Only in Phase 5**: Develop independently through Phase 4, integrate in final phase

### Test-First Approach
- **Comprehensive Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, load, and acceptance tests for all features
- **Quality Gates**: Validation checkpoints before moving between phases
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Document and test 20+ edge cases per major feature
- **Performance Validation**: Load testing with specific concurrent user targets

### Continuous Integration
- **Regular Integration**: Weekly check-ins and monthly reviews
- **Docker Requirements**: All modules run in containers starting Phase 3
- **Independent Verification**: Each module works without dependencies on others until Phase 5
- **Automated Testing**: CI pipeline validates all changes

### Multi-Model Review
- **Quality Assurance**: Use multiple AI models (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) for validation
- **Cross-Verification**: Different models review specifications and implementations
- **Consensus Building**: Resolve conflicts through multi-model analysis
- **Artifact Preservation**: Maintain development artifacts for transparency
