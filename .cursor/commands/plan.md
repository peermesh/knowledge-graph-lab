# SpecKit Plan Command

Creates detailed implementation plans from implementation-ready specifications.

**Usage:**
1. Have an implementation-ready specification (400-600 lines)
2. Run this command to generate a technical implementation plan
3. Review and refine the plan with specific technology choices

**Input:** Implementation-ready specification
**Output:** Technical implementation plan with architecture decisions

**Key Features:**
- Defines system architecture and component structure
- Identifies technology stack and frameworks
- Creates detailed implementation roadmap
- Specifies integration points and APIs
- Outlines deployment and infrastructure needs

**Example:**
```
Create an implementation plan for the AI Development Module specification. Use .NET Aspire with PostgreSQL database, React frontend, and FastAPI backend.
```

**Technology Guidance:**
- Specify exact versions (e.g., ".NET 8", "React 18.2")
- Choose specific databases (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB)
- Define API standards (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
- Select deployment targets (Docker, Kubernetes, cloud services)
