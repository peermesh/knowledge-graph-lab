# SpecKit Tasks Command

Converts implementation plans into structured, actionable task lists with dependencies.

**Usage:**
1. Have a technical implementation plan
2. Run this command to generate a task breakdown
3. Review and organize tasks by priority and dependencies

**Input:** Technical implementation plan
**Output:** Structured task list with dependencies and effort estimates

**Key Features:**
- Breaks complex features into manageable tasks (5-15 tasks per feature)
- Identifies task dependencies and execution order
- Estimates effort for each task (hours/days)
- Marks parallel vs sequential execution
- Defines acceptance criteria for each task

**Task States:**
- **pending**: Not yet started
- **in_progress**: Currently working on
- **completed**: Finished successfully
- **cancelled**: No longer needed

**Example:**
```
Break down the AI Development Module implementation plan into actionable tasks. Include database setup, API development, frontend implementation, and testing phases.
```

**Best Practices:**
- Aim for 5-15 tasks per major feature
- Include at least one task in each completion state for demonstration
- Mark parallel tasks clearly for concurrent execution
- Define clear acceptance criteria for each task
